# Migrating to Citus

If your existing application matches Citus [Use cases](../use-cases.md), then you can make the two work together.

- [Migrating to Citus](migration.md) outlines updating schemas and queries to step-by-step instructions for Rails and Django apps.
- [Query performance tuning](../performance-tuning.md) can help you get the most performance out of a new application on Citus, including more about table distribution columns.
- [Cluster management](../cluster-management.md) can help you decide the best cluster size for a new application.

If you're migrating to Citus, try [Citus Cloud](../citus-cloud.md).
