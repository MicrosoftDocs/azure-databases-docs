# Managed service

One of the easiest ways to get started with Citus is to spin up a cluster in the cloud on Azure. The Citus managed service is available as elastic clusters on [Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible server](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/adforpostgresql/postgres-horizontal-scaling-with-elastic-clusters-on-azure-database-for-postgres/4303508).

Elastic clusters bring Citus horizontal scaling capabilities to Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible server, providing a fully managed PostgreSQL solution with built-in sharding and distribution.
