> **[Azure Database Migration Service (classic) - SQL scenarios are on a deprecation path](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/retirement-azure-database-migration-service-classic-sql-server-scenarios-deprecation/)**. After **August 1, 2023**, you can't create new Database Migration Service (classic) resources for SQL Server scenarios from Azure portal. The service is retired from **March 15, 2026** for all customers. For seamless migrations from multiple database sources to Azure SQL targets, use the latest version of [Azure Database Migration Service](../dms-overview.md) via the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/dmsazureportal), or through [Migrate databases at scale using automation](../migration-dms-powershell-cli.md). For more information, see [Retirement notice: Database Migration Service (classic)](https://aka.ms/dmsclassicportal).
