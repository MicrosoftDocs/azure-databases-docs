- If migrating a single database, the database backups must be placed in a flat-file structure inside a database folder (including the container root folder), and the folders can't be nested, as it's not supported.
- If migrating multiple databases using the same Azure Blob Storage container, you must place backup files for different databases in separate folders inside the container.
- Overwriting existing databases using DMS in your target Azure SQL Managed Instance isn't supported.
- DMS doesn't support configuring high availability and disaster recovery on your target to match the source topology.
- The following server objects aren't supported:
   - SQL Server Agent jobs
   - Credentials
   - SSIS packages
   - Server audit
- You can't use an existing self-hosted integration runtime created from Azure Data Factory for database migrations with DMS. Initially, the self-hosted integration runtime should be created using the Azure SQL migration extension in Azure Data Studio and can be reused for further database migrations.
- A single LRS job (created by DMS) can run for a maximum of 30 days. When this period expires, the job is automatically canceled thus your target database gets automatically deleted.
- If you received the following error: `Memory-optimized filegroup must be empty in order to be restored on General Purpose tier of SQL Database Managed Instance`. This issue is by design, Hekaton (**also known as SQL Server In-Memory OLTP**) isn't supported on General Purpose tier of Azure SQL Managed Instance. To continue migration, one way is to upgrade to Business Critical tier, which supports Hekaton. Another way is to make sure the source database isn't using it while the Azure SQL Managed Instance is General Purpose.
