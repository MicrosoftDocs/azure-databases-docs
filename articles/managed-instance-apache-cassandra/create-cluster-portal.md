# Quickstart: Create an Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra cluster from the Azure portal

Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra is a fully managed service for pure open-source Apache Cassandra clusters. The service also allows configurations to be overridden, depending on the specific needs of each workload, for maximum flexibility and control.

This quickstart demonstrates how to use the Azure portal to create an Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra cluster.

## Prerequisite

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn) before you begin.

## Create a managed instance cluster

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. In the search bar, search for **Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra** and select the result.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-cluster-portal/search-portal.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot that shows searching for Azure SQL Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra." lightbox="media/create-cluster-portal/search-portal.png":::

1. Select **Create Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra cluster**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-cluster-portal/create-cluster.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the button used to create the cluster." lightbox="media/create-cluster-portal/create-cluster.png":::

1. On the **Create Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra** pane, enter the following information:
   - **Subscription**: From the dropdown list, select your Azure subscription.
   - **Resource group**: Specify whether you want to create a new resource group or use an existing one. A resource group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution.
   - **Cluster name**: Enter a name for your cluster.
   - **Location**: Select the location to deploy the cluster.
   - **Cassandra version**: Select the version of Apache Cassandra to deploy.
   - **Extension**: Select extensions to add, including [Cassandra Lucene Index](search-lucene-index.md). This is only relevant for Cassandra v3.11.
   - **Initial Cassandra admin password**: Enter the password used to create the cluster.
   - **Confirm Cassandra admin password**: Reenter your password.
   - **Virtual network**: Select an existing virtual network and subnet, or create a new one. Please take a note of [network rules](./network-rules.md) or you can use [VPN based configuration](./use-vpn.md).
   - **Assign roles**: Virtual networks require special permissions to allow managed Cassandra clusters to be deployed. Keep this box selected if you create a new virtual network or use an existing virtual network without permissions applied. If you use a virtual network where you previously deployed Azure SQL Managed Instance Cassandra clusters, clear this option.

      :::image type="content" source="media/create-cluster-portal/create-cluster-page.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Basics tab on the Create page." lightbox="media/create-cluster-portal/create-cluster-page.png":::

   If you use a [virtual private network](use-vpn.md), you don't need to open another connection.

   The deployment of Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra requires internet access. Deployment fails in environments where internet access is restricted. Make sure that you aren't blocking access in your virtual network to the following vital Azure services that are necessary for Managed Cassandra to work properly. For more information, see [Required outbound network rules](network-rules.md).
      - Azure Storage
      - Azure Key Vault
      - Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets
      - Azure Monitor
      - Microsoft Entra ID
      - Microsoft Defender for Cloud

   - **Auto replicate**: Choose the form of autoreplication to use. For more information, see [Turnkey replication](#turnkey-replication).
   - **Schedule event strategy**: The strategy the cluster uses for scheduled events.

    > [!TIP]
    > - `StopANY` means stop any node when there's a scheduled event for the node.
    > - `StopByRack` means stop nodes only in a specific rack for a specific scheduled event. For instance, if several events are scheduled for nodes in different racks at the same time, nodes in only one rack stop. Other nodes in other racks are delayed.

1. Select the **Data center** tab.

1. Enter the following information:
   - **Data center name**: Enter a datacenter name in the text field.
   - **Availability zone**: Select this checkbox if you want to enable availability zones.
   - **SKU size**: Choose from the available virtual machine (VM) product tier sizes.

      :::image type="content" source="media/create-cluster-portal/l-sku-sizes.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting a product tier size." lightbox="media/create-cluster-portal/l-sku-sizes.png":::

   We introduced write-through caching (public preview) by using L-series VM product tiers. This implementation aims to minimize tail latencies and enhance read performance, particularly for read-intensive workloads. These specific product tiers are equipped with locally attached disks, which ensure increased IOPS for read operations and reduced tail latency.

   Write-through caching is provided without a service-level agreement (SLA). We don't recommend it for production workloads. For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).
   - **No. of disks**: Choose the number of p30 disks to be attached to each Cassandra node.
   - **No. of nodes**: Choose the number of Cassandra nodes to deploy to this datacenter.

      :::image type="content" source="media/create-cluster-portal/create-datacenter-page.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Data center tab where you can review the values." lightbox="media/create-cluster-portal/create-datacenter-page.png":::

   Availability zones aren't supported in all regions. Deployments fail if you select a region where availability zones aren't supported. For more information, see the [Azure regions list](/azure/reliability/availability-zones-region-support).

   The successful deployment of availability zones is also subject to the availability of compute resources in all the zones in the specific region. Deployments might fail if the product tier you selected, or capacity, isn't available across all the zones.

1. Select **Review + create** > **Create**.

   It can take up to 15 minutes to create a cluster.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-cluster-portal/review-create.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Review + create page for the cluster." lightbox="media/create-cluster-portal/review-create.png":::

1. After the deployment finishes, check your resource group to see the newly created managed instance cluster.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-cluster-portal/managed-instance.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Overview page after the cluster is created." lightbox="media/create-cluster-portal/managed-instance.png":::

1. To browse through the cluster nodes, go to the cluster resource and open the **Data Center** pane.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-cluster-portal/datacenter.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot that shows datacenter nodes." lightbox="media/create-cluster-portal/datacenter.png":::

## Scale a datacenter

After you deploy a cluster with a single datacenter, you can scale horizontally or vertically. Highlight the datacenter and then select **Scale**.

:::image type="content" source="media/create-cluster-portal/datacenter-scale-1.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot that shows scaling datacenter nodes." lightbox="media/create-cluster-portal/datacenter-scale-1.png":::

### Horizontal scale

To scale out or scale in on nodes, move the slider to the number that you want. You can also edit the value. When you're finished, select **Scale**.

:::image type="content" source="media/create-cluster-portal/datacenter-scale-2.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting the number of datacenter nodes." lightbox="media/create-cluster-portal/datacenter-scale-2.png":::

### Vertical scale

To scale up or scale down the product tier size for your nodes, select options from the **SKU Size** dropdown list. When you're finished, select **Scale**.

:::image type="content" source="media/create-cluster-portal/datacenter-scale-3.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting the product tier size." lightbox="media/create-cluster-portal/datacenter-scale-3.png":::

The length of time that it takes for a scaling operation depends on various factors. The operation might take several minutes. When Azure notifies you that the scale operation is finished, it doesn't mean that all of your nodes joined the Cassandra ring. Nodes are fully commissioned when they all show a status of **Healthy** and the datacenter status reads **Succeeded**.

Scaling is an online operation and works in the same manner as described for patching. For more information, see [Patching](management-operations.md#patching).

## Add a datacenter

1. To add another datacenter, on the **Data Center** pane, select **Add**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-cluster-portal/add-datacenter.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot that shows adding a datacenter." lightbox="media/create-cluster-portal/add-datacenter.png":::

   If you add a datacenter in a different region, you need to select a different virtual network. Ensure that this virtual network has connectivity to the primary region's virtual network that was created previously. Also, make sure that any other virtual networks that host datacenters are within the managed instance cluster. For more information, see [Connect virtual networks with virtual network peering](/azure/virtual-network/tutorial-connect-virtual-networks-portal#peer-virtual-networks).

   Make sure that you applied the appropriate role to your virtual network before you attempt to deploy a managed instance cluster. Use the following Azure CLI command:

   ```azurecli-interactive
      az role assignment create \
      --assignee a232010e-820c-4083-83bb-3ace5fc29d0b \
      --role 4d97b98b-1d4f-4787-a291-c67834d212e7 \
      --scope /subscriptions/<subscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<vnetName>
   ```

1. Fill in the appropriate fields:
   * **Datacenter name**: From the dropdown list, select your Azure subscription.
   * **Availability zone**: Select if you want to enable availability zones in this datacenter.
   * **Location**: Location where your datacenter is deployed.
   * **SKU size**: Choose from the available VM product tier sizes.
   * **No. of disks**: Choose the number of p30 disks to be attached to each Cassandra node.
   * **No. of nodes**: Choose the number of Cassandra nodes to deploy to this datacenter.
   * **Virtual network**: Select an existing virtual network and subnet.

      :::image type="content" source="media/create-cluster-portal/add-datacenter-2.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Add Data Center page." lightbox="media/create-cluster-portal/add-datacenter-2.png":::

   The Azure portal doesn't allow creation of a new virtual network when you add a datacenter. You need to choose an existing virtual network and you need to ensure that there's connectivity between the target subnets where datacenters are deployed. You also need to apply the appropriate role to the virtual network to allow deployment, as described previously.

1. When the datacenter is deployed, you should be able to view all the datacenter information on the **Data Center** pane.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-cluster-portal/multi-datacenter.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the cluster resources." lightbox="media/create-cluster-portal/multi-datacenter.png":::

1. To ensure replication between datacenters, connect to [Cassandra Query Language Shell (CQLSH)](#connect-from-cqlsh) and use the following CQL query to update the replication strategy in each keyspace to include all the datacenters across the cluster. System tables are updated automatically.

   ```bash
   ALTER KEYSPACE "ks" WITH REPLICATION = {'class': 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'dc': 3, 'dc2': 3};
   ```

1. If you add a datacenter to a cluster that already has data, run `rebuild` to replicate the historical data. In the Azure CLI, use the following command and run `nodetool rebuild` on each node of the new datacenter. This action replaces `<new dc ip address>` with the IP address of the node and replaces `<olddc>` with the name of your existing datacenter:

   ```azurecli-interactive
    az managed-cassandra cluster invoke-command \
      --resource-group $resourceGroupName \
      --cluster-name $clusterName \
      --host <new dc ip address> \
      --command-name nodetool --arguments rebuild="" "<olddc>"=""
   ```

Don't allow application clients to write to the new datacenter until you apply keyspace replication changes. Otherwise, rebuild doesn't work and you need to create a [support request](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/newsupportrequest) so that our team can run `repair` for you.

## Update Cassandra configuration

You can use the Azure portal or [CLI commands](manage-resources-cli.md#update-yaml) to update Cassandra YAML configuration on a datacenter. To update settings in the portal:

1. Under **Settings**, select **Cassandra Configuration**. Highlight the datacenter whose configuration you want to change, and then select **Update**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-cluster-portal/update-config-1.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting the datacenter to update configuration." lightbox="media/create-cluster-portal/update-config-1.png":::

1. In the window that opens, enter the field names in YAML format, as shown here. Then select **Update**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-cluster-portal/update-config-2.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot that shows updating the datacenter Cassandra configuration." lightbox="media/create-cluster-portal/update-config-2.png":::

1. When the update is finished, the overridden values appear on the **Cassandra Configuration** pane.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-cluster-portal/update-config-3.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the updated Cassandra configuration." lightbox="media/create-cluster-portal/update-config-3.png":::

   Only overridden Cassandra configuration values are shown in the Azure portal.

   Ensure that the Cassandra YAML settings that you provide are appropriate for the version of Cassandra that you deployed. For more information, see [Cassandra v5.0] (https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-5.0/conf/cassandra.yaml) and [Cassandra v4.0](https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-4.0/conf/cassandra.yaml) for v4.0 and [Cassandra v3.11](https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-3.11/conf/cassandra.yaml) for Cassandra v3.11 settings. You can't update the following YAML settings:

   - `cluster_name`
   - `seed_provider`
   - `initial_token`
   - `autobootstrap`
   - `client_encryption_options`
   - `server_encryption_options`
   - `transparent_data_encryption_options`
   - `audit_logging_options`
   - `authenticator`
   - `authorizer`
   - `role_manager`
   - `storage_port`
   - `ssl_storage_port`
   - `native_transport_port`
   - `native_transport_port_ssl`
   - `listen_address`
   - `listen_interface`
   - `broadcast_address`
   - `hints_directory`
   - `data_file_directories`
   - `commitlog_directory`
   - `cdc_raw_directory`
   - `saved_caches_directory`
   - `endpoint_snitch`
   - `partitioner`
   - `rpc_address`
   - `rpc_interface`

## Update the Cassandra version

Cassandra 5.0 and Turnkey version updates are in public preview. These features are provided without an SLA. We don't recommend these features for production workloads. For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

You can conduct in-place major version upgrades directly from the portal or through the Azure CLI, Terraform, or Azure Resource Manager templates.

1. On the **Overview** tab, select **Update**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-cluster-portal/cluster-version-1.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot that shows updating the Cassandra version." lightbox="media/create-cluster-portal/cluster-version-1.png":::

1. Select the Cassandra version from the dropdown list.

   Don't skip versions. We recommend that you update from only one version to another. For example, update 3.11 to 4.0 or 4.0 to 4.1 or 4.1 to 5.0.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-cluster-portal/cluster-version.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting the Cassandra version." lightbox="media/create-cluster-portal/cluster-version.png":::

1. Select **Update** to save.

### Turnkey replication

Cassandra 5.0 introduces a streamlined approach to deploy multi-region clusters, which offer enhanced convenience and efficiency. If you use turnkey replication functionality, setting up and managing multi-region clusters is more accessible. You gain smoother integration and operation across distributed environments.

This update reduces the complexities that are associated with deploying and maintaining multiple region configurations. Users can use Cassandra's capabilities with greater ease and effectiveness.

:::image type="content" source="media/create-cluster-portal/auto-replicate.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting an option from the dropdown list." lightbox="media/create-cluster-portal/auto-replicate.png":::

- **None**: The **Auto Replicate** option is set to **None**.
- **System Keyspaces**: Autoreplicate all system keyspaces (`system_auth`, `system_traces`, and `system_auth`).
- **All Keyspaces**: Autoreplicate all keyspaces, monitor if new keyspaces are created, and then apply autoreplicate settings automatically.

#### Autoreplication scenarios

When you add a new datacenter, the autoreplicate feature in Cassandra seamlessly runs `nodetool rebuild` to ensure the successful replication of data across the added datacenter. Removing a datacenter triggers an automatic removal of the specific datacenter from the keyspaces.

For external datacenters, such as those hosted on-premises, use the external datacenter property to include them in the keyspaces. This approach enables Cassandra to incorporate these external datacenters as sources for the rebuilding process.

If you set **Auto Replicate** to **All Keyspaces**, your keyspaces replication changes to include:

`WITH REPLICATION = { 'class' : 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'on-prem-datacenter-1' : 3, 'mi-datacenter-1': 3 }`

If this topology isn't what you want, use **SystemKeyspaces**, adjust them yourself, and run `nodetool rebuild` manually on the Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra cluster.

## Deallocate a cluster

For nonproduction environments, you can pause or deallocate resources in the cluster to avoid being charged for them. You continue to be charged for storage. First, change **Cluster Type** to **NonProduction**, and then select **Deallocate**.

Use the **NonProduction** cluster type only to save development costs. This cluster type might come with smaller product tiers. *Don't* use it to run production workloads.

- Cluster types defined as **NonProduction** don't have SLA guarantees applied to them.
- Don't run any schema or write operations during deallocation. This action can lead to data loss. In rare cases, you might experience schema corruption, which requires manual intervention from the support team.

:::image type="content" source="media/create-cluster-portal/pause-cluster.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot that shows pausing a cluster." lightbox="media/create-cluster-portal/pause-cluster.png":::

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error when you apply permissions to your virtual network when you use the Azure CLI, you can apply the same permission manually from the Azure portal. An example of such an error is "Cannot find user or service principal in graph database for `e5007d2c-4b13-4a74-9b6a-605d99f03501`." For more information, see [Use the Azure portal to add Azure Cosmos DB service principal](add-service-principal.md).

The Azure Cosmos DB role assignment is used for deployment purposes only. Azure Managed Instanced for Apache Cassandra has no back-end dependencies on Azure Cosmos DB.

## Connect to your cluster

Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra doesn't create nodes with public IP addresses. To connect to your newly created Cassandra cluster, create another resource inside the virtual network. This resource could be an application or a VM with Apache's open-source query tool [CQLSH](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/stable/cassandra/managing/tools/cqlsh.html) installed. You can use a [template](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/vm-simple-linux/) to deploy an Ubuntu VM.

### Connect from CQLSH

After the VM is deployed, use Secure Shell to connect to the machine. To install CQLSH, use the following commands:

```bash
# Install default-jre and default-jdk
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk openjdk-8-jre

# Install the Cassandra libraries in order to get CQLSH:
echo "deb http://archive.apache.org/dist/cassandra/debian 311x main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cassandra.sources.list
curl https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/KEYS | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cassandra

# Export the SSL variables:
export SSL_VERSION=TLSv1_2
export SSL_VALIDATE=false

# Connect to CQLSH (replace <IP> with the private IP addresses of a node in your Datacenter):
host=("<IP>")
initial_admin_password="Password provided when creating the cluster"
cqlsh $host 9042 -u cassandra -p $initial_admin_password --ssl
```

### Connect from an application

As with CQLSH, when you use one of the supported [Apache Cassandra client drivers](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/stable/cassandra/getting-started/drivers.html) to connect from an application, Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer (TLS/SSL) encryption must be enabled and certificate verification must be disabled. For samples that are used to connect to Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra, see [Java](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cassandra-mi-java-v4-getting-started), [.NET](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cassandra-mi-dotnet-core-getting-started), [Node.js](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cassandra-mi-nodejs-getting-started), and [Python](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cassandra-mi-python-v4-getting-started).

We recommend that you disable certificate verification because it doesn't work unless you map IP addresses of your cluster nodes to the appropriate domain. If an internal policy mandates that you perform TLS/SSL certificate verification for any application, add entries like `10.0.1.5 host1.managedcassandra.cosmos.azure.com` in your hosts file for each node to facilitate this setup. If you take this approach, you also need to add new entries whenever you scale up nodes.

For Java, we recommend that you enable the [speculative execution policy](https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/4.10/manual/core/speculative_execution/) where applications are sensitive to tail latency. For a demo that illustrates how this approach works and to see how to enable the policy, see [Demo: Implement speculative execution](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cassandra-mi-java-v4-speculative-execution).

In most cases, it *shouldn't be necessary* to configure or install certificates (such as `rootCA`, `node`, `client`, or `truststore`) to connect to Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra. To enable TLS/SSL encryption, use the default trust store and password of the runtime that the client is using. That environment trusts the Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra certificates. In rare cases, if the certificate isn't trusted, you might need to add it to the trust store. For sample code, see [Java](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cassandra-mi-java-v4-getting-started), [.NET](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cassandra-mi-dotnet-core-getting-started), [Node.js](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cassandra-mi-nodejs-getting-started), and [Python](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cassandra-mi-python-v4-getting-started).

### Configure client certificates (optional)

Configuring client certificates is optional. A client application can connect to Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra if the preceding steps are finished. If you prefer, you can also create and configure client certificates for authentication. In general, there are two ways to create certificates:

- **Self-signed certificates:** Private and public certificates with no Certificate Authority (CA) for each node. In this case, you need all public certificates.
- **Certificates signed by a CA:** Certificates issued by a self-signed CA or a public CA. In this case, you need the root CA certificate and all intermediaries, if applicable. For more information, see [Prepare SSL certificates for production](https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra-oss/3.x/cassandra/configuration/secureSSLCertWithCA.html).

If you want to implement client-to-node certificate authentication or mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS), use the Azure CLI to provide the certificates. The following command uploads and applies your client certificates to the trust store for the managed instance cluster. You don't need to edit `cassandra.yaml` settings. After you apply the command, your cluster requires Cassandra to verify the certificates when a client connects. For more information, see `require_client_auth: true` in Cassandra [client_encryption_options](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/stable/cassandra/managing/configuration/cass_yaml_file.html).

```azurecli-interactive
resourceGroupName='<Resource_Group_Name>'
clusterName='<Cluster Name>'

az managed-cassandra cluster update \
  --resource-group $resourceGroupName \
  --cluster-name $clusterName \
  --client-certificates /usr/csuser/clouddrive/rootCert.pem /usr/csuser/clouddrive/intermediateCert.pem
```

## Clean up resources

If you aren't going to continue to use this managed instance cluster, follow these steps to delete it:

1. On the left menu of the Azure portal, select **Resource groups**.
1. From the list, select the resource group that you created for this quickstart.
1. On the resource group **Overview** pane, select **Delete resource group**.
1. On the next pane, enter the name of the resource group to delete, and then select **Delete**.
