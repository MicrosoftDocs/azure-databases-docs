# Configure zone-redundant high availability in an Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server instance using Azure CLI

This sample CLI script configures and manages [High availability concepts in Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server](../concepts-high-availability.md) in an Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server.
You can enable Zone-Redundant high availability only during Flexible Server creation, and can disable it anytime. You can also choose the availability zone for the primary and the standby replica.

Currently, Zone-Redundant high availability is supported only for the General purpose and Business Critical pricing tiers.
