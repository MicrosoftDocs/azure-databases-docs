# Restore an Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server instance using Azure CLI

Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server, automatically creates server backups and securely stores them in local redundant storage within the region.

This sample CLI script performs a [point-in-time restore](../concepts-backup-restore.md) and creates a new server from your Flexible Server's backups.

The new Flexible Server is created with the original server's configuration and also inherits tags and settings such as virtual network and firewall from the source server. The restored server's compute and storage tier, configuration and security settings can be changed after the restore is completed.
