- For servers with [customer-managed keys (CMK)](concepts-customer-managed-key.md), enabling [accelerated logs](./concepts-accelerated-logs.md) might not work due to a current limitation. You can temporarily disable CMK, enable accelerated logs, and re-enable CMK as a workaround. 

  To learn more, visit [Accelerated logs](./concepts-accelerated-logs.md).

## January 2025

### Default zone-resiliency for Business-Critical service tier

You now benefit from the highest level of availability against infrastructure failures within an availability zone at no extra cost for mission-critical workloads running on the Business-Critical service tier. Regardless of whether your flexible servers are enabled with High Availability (HA), your server data and log files are hosted in zone-redundant storage by default. While zone-redundant HA-enabled servers continue to benefit from a 99.99% uptime SLA from the built-in zonal redundancy and hot standby, non-HA servers can recover quickly from zonal outages using zone-redundant backups. This enhancement applies to all new servers provisioned in the Business-Critical service tier.

> [!NOTE]
> Based on customer feedback requesting the ability to choose their preferred deployment type, we’ve decided to roll back Default zone-resiliency for Business-Critical service tier. Now, for both Business Critical and General-Purpose servers, customers must select the High Availability (HA) mode either same-zone or zone-redundant at the time of server creation. This selection is final and cannot be modified later.
