### Connect to a VM using Remote Desktop (RDP)

After you've created **myVm**, connect to it from the internet as follows:

1. In the portal's search bar, enter *myVm*.

1. Select the **Connect** button. After selecting the **Connect** button, **Connect to virtual machine** opens.

1. Select **Download RDP File**. Azure creates a Remote Desktop Protocol (*.rdp*) file and downloads it to your computer.

1. Open the *downloaded.rdp* file.

    1. If prompted, select **Connect**.

    1. Enter the username and password you specified when creating the VM.

      > [!NOTE]  
      > You might need to select **More choices** > **Use a different account** to specify the credentials you entered when you created the VM.

1. Select **OK**.

1. You might receive a certificate warning during the sign-in process. Select **Yes** or **Continue** if you receive a certificate warning.

1. Once the VM desktop appears, minimize it to go back to your local desktop.

### Access the Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server instance privately from the VM

1. In the Remote Desktop of *myVM*, open PowerShell.

1. Enter `nslookup myServer.privatelink.mysql.database.azure.com`.

    You receive a message similar to this:

    ```azurepowershell
    Server: UnKnown
    Address: 168.63.129.16
    Non-authoritative answer:
    Name: myServer.privatelink.mysql.database.azure.com
    Address: 10.x.x.x
    ```

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Regardless of the firewall settings or public access being disabled, the ping and telnet tests will successfully verify network connectivity.

1. Test the private link connection for the Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server instance using any available client. The following example uses [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/wb-installing-windows.html) to do the operation.

1. In **New connection**, then select this information:

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
