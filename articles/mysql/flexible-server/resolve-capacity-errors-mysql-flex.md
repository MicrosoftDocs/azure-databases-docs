# Resolve capacity errors for Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server

The article describes how you can resolve capacity errors when deploying or scaling Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server.

## Exceeded quota

If you encounter any of the following errors when attempting to deploy your Azure MySQL - Flexible Server resource, [submit a request to increase your quota](how-to-request-quota-increase.md).

- `Operation could not be completed as it results in exceeding approved {0} Cores quota. Additional details - Current Limit: {1}, Current Usage: {2}, Additional Required: {3}, (Minimum) New Limit Required: {4}.Submit a request for Quota increase by specifying parameters listed in the 'Details' section for deployment to succeed.`

## Subscription access

Your subscription might not have access to create a server in the selected region if your subscription isn't registered with the MySQL resource provider (RP).

If you see any of the following errors, [Register your subscription with the MySQL RP](#register-with-mysql-rp) to resolve it.

- `Your subscription does not have access to create a server in the selected region.`

- `Provisioning is restricted in this region. Please choose a different region. For exceptions to this rule please open a support request with issue type of 'Service and subscription limits'`

- `Location 'region name' is not accepting creation of new Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible servers for the subscription 'subscription id' at this time`

## Enable region

Your subscription might not have access to create a server in the selected region. To resolve this issue, [file a support request to access a region](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade).

If you see the following errors, file a support ticket to enable the specific region:
- `Subscription 'Subscription name' is not allowed to provision in 'region name`
-  `Subscriptions are restricted from provisioning in this region. Please choose a different region. For exceptions to this rule please open a support request with the Issue type of 'Service and subscription limits.`

## Availability Zone

If you receive the following errors, select a different availability zone.

- `Availability zone '{ID}' is not available for subscription '{Sub ID}' in this region temporarily due to capacity constraints.`
- `Multi-Zone HA is not supported in this region. Please choose a different region. For exceptions to this rule please open a support request with the Issue type of 'Service and subscription limits'.`

## SKU Not Available

If you encounter the following error, select a different SKU type. Availability of SKU might differ across regions, either the specific SKU isn't supported in the region or temporarily unavailable.

`Specified SKU is not supported in this region. Please choose a different SKU.`

## Register with MySQL RP

To deploy Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server resources, register your subscription with the MySQL resource provider (RP).

You can register your subscription using the Azure portal, [the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli), or [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell).
