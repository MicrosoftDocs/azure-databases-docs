## Restore from an exported on-demand full backup

1. Download the backup file from the Azure storage account using Azure Storage Explorer.

1. Install the MySQL community version from MySQL. Download MySQL Community Server. The downloaded version must be the same or compatible with the version of the exported
backups.

1. Open the command prompt and navigate to the bin directory of the downloaded MySQL community version folder.

1. Now specify the data directory using `--datadir` by running the following command at the command prompt:

    ```bash
    mysqld --datadir=<path to the data folder of the files downloaded>
    ```

1. Connect to the database using any supported client.
