We're excited to announce the July 2025 version of Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server. Starting July 1, 2025, all new servers will automatically be onboarded to this latest version. Existing servers are upgraded during their next scheduled maintenance. If you prefer to upgrade your servers earlier, you can enroll in our Virtual Canary Program by following this [link](https://aka.ms/mysql/virtual-canary).

This new version introduces a range of new features and enhancements, resolves known issues, and includes essential security patches to ensure optimal performance and security.

After the maintenance succeeds, you can run the following command in the Azure CLI to check the Azure MySQL minor version as well:

```bash
