## Features

### [Accelerated logs feature in Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server](../concepts-accelerated-logs.md)

- This feature is available within the Business-Critical service tier, which significantly enhances the performance of Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server instances. It offers a dynamic solution designed for high throughput needs, reducing latency with no additional cost.

## Improvement

- Improved server restart logic, server restart has a timeout of 2 hours for none burstable servers, 4 hours timeout for burstable servers. After server restart workflow timeout, it would roll back and set the server state to Succeeded.
- Improved the data-in replication procedures to show the real error message and safe exit when exception happens.
- Read replica improvement for the creation workflow to precheck the virtual network setting.

## Known issues fixes

- Fixed the issue that the server parameter max_connections and table_open_cache can't be configured correctly
- Fixed the issue where executing `CREATE AADUSER IF NOT EXISTS 'myuser' IDENTIFIED BY 'CLIENT_ID'` when the user already exists incorrectly set the binlog record, affecting replica and high availability functionalities.
