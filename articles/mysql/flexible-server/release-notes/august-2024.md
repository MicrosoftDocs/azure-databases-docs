# Azure Database For MySQL - Flexible Server August 2024 maintenance

We're pleased to announce the August 2024 maintenance of the Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server. This maintenance updates all existing 8.0.34 and, after, engine version servers to the 8.0.37 engine version, along with several security improvements and known issue fixes.

## Engine version changes

The existing engine version is >=8.0.34, and the server upgrades to the 8.0.37 engine version.
To check your engine version, run `SELECT VERSION();` command at the MySQL prompt

> [!NOTE]  
> Percona has identified a [critical bug](https://www.percona.com/blog/do-not-upgrade-to-any-version-of-mysql-after-8-0-37/?utm_campaign=2024-blog-q3&utm_content=300046226&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin&hss_channel=lcp-421929) in MySQL versions 8.0.38, 8.4.1, and 9.0.0 that causes the MySQL daemon to crash upon restart if over 10,000 tables exist. Azure MySQL will not upgrade to the buggy MySQL versions 8.0.38, 8.4.1, and 9.0.0 in the August maintenance. Instead, we will skip these versions and upgrade directly to a future MySQL engine version that has resolved this issue. Microsoft Azure MySQL remains committed to providing customers with the most secure and stable PaaS database service.

## Features

No new features are being introduced in this maintenance update.

## Improvement

- Many security improvements have been made to the service during this maintenance.

## Known issues fixes

- Fix the issue that for some servers migrated from single server to flexible server, execute table partition leads to table corrupted
- Fix the issue that for some servers with audit/slow log enabled, when a large number of logs are generated, these servers might be missing server metrics, and start operation might be stuck for these servers if they are in a stopped state.
