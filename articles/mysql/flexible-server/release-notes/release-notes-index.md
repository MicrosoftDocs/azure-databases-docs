# Azure Database for MySQL – Release notes index

Welcome to the centralized index of release notes for **Azure Database for MySQL**. This page provides a year-by-year overview of all published release notes, helping you stay informed about platform updates, feature enhancements, and bug fixes.

> [!NOTE]
> Each release note typically applies to servers **created after a specific date**, which is clearly mentioned in the document. However, due to Azure’s **region-by-region deployment model**, the actual rollout may span up to a week globally. Please read the deployment notes carefully.
