# Replicate data from Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server

Data-out replication allows you to synchronize data out of an Azure Database for MySQL flexible server instance to another MySQL server using MySQL native replication. The MySQL server (replica) can be on-premises, in virtual machines, or a database service hosted by other cloud providers. While [Replicate data into Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server](concepts-data-in-replication.md) helps to move data into an Azure Database for MySQL flexible server instance (replica), Data-out replication would allow you to transfer data out of an Azure Database for MySQL flexible server instance (Primary). With Data-out replication, the binary log (binlog) is made community consumable, allowing the an Azure Database for MySQL flexible server instance to act as a Primary server for the external replicas. To learn more about binlog replication, see the [MySQL binlog replication overview](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/binlog-replication-configuration-overview.html).

> [!NOTE]  
> Data-out replication is not supported on an Azure Database for MySQL flexible server instance that has Azure authentication configured.

The main scenarios to consider about using Data-out replication are:

- **Hybrid Data Synchronization:** Data-out replication can be used to keep the data synchronized between Azure Database for MySQL flexible server and on-premises servers. This method will help to integrate seamlessly between cloud and on-premises systems in a hybrid solution. This solution can also be useful if you want to avoid vendor lock-in.

- **Multi-Cloud Synchronization:** For complex cloud solutions, use Data-out replication to synchronize data between Azure Database for MySQL flexible server and different cloud providers, including virtual machines and database services hosted in those clouds.

- **Migration:** Customers can do Minimal Time migration using open-source tools such as MyDumper/MyLoader with Data-out replication to migrate data out of Azure Database for MySQL flexible server.

## Limitations and considerations

<a id="azure-ad-isnt-supported"></a>

### Microsoft Entra ID isn't supported

Data-out replication isn't supported on an Azure Database for MySQL flexible server instance that has Azure authentication configured. Any Microsoft Entra transaction (Microsoft Entra user create/update) on the source server will break data-out replication.

> [!TIP]  
> Use guidance published here - MySQL :: MySQL Replication :: 2.7.3 Skipping Transactions to skip past an event or events by issuing a CHANGE MASTER TO statement to move the source's binary log position forward. Restart replication posts the action.

### Filter

You must use the replication filter to filter out Azure custom tables on the replica server. This can be achieved by setting Replicate_Wild_Ignore_Table = "mysql.\_\_%" to filter the Azure MySQL internal tables on the replica. To modify this parameter from the Azure portal, navigate to the Azure Database for MySQL flexible server instance and select **Server parameters** to view/edit the Replicate_Wild_Ignore_Table parameter.

Refer to the following general guidance on the replication filter in MySQL manual:
- MySQL 5.7 Reference Manual - [13.4.2.2 CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER Statement](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/change-replication-filter.html)
- MySQL 5.7 Reference Manual - [16.1.6.3 Replica Server Options and Variables](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-options-replica.html#option_mysqld_replicate-wild-ignore-table)
- MySQL 8.0 Reference Manual - [17.2.5.4 Replication Channel Based Filters](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-rules-channel-based-filters.html)
