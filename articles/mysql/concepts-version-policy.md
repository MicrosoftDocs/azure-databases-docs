# Azure Database for MySQL version support policy

Azure Database for MySQL provides a fully managed database service powered by the MySQL community edition, enabling developers to build and scale applications efficiently. This article outlines the version support policy for Azure Database for MySQL, detailing the lifecycle management, including version availability, updates, and end-of-support timelines. By understanding this policy, customers can ensure their applications remain secure, performant, and aligned with the latest MySQL innovations while minimizing disruption during version transitions.

## Supported MySQL versions

Azure Database for MySQL was developed from the [MySQL Community Edition](https://www.mysql.com/products/community/), using the InnoDB storage engine. The service supports the community's current major versions, namely MySQL 5.7 and 8.0. MySQL uses the X.Y.Z. naming scheme where X is the major version, Y is the minor version, and Z is the bug fix release. For more information about the scheme, see the [MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/which-version.html).

Azure Database for MySQL currently supports the following major and minor versions of MySQL:

| Version | [Flexible Server?](flexible-server/overview.md)<br />Current minor version |
| :--- | :--- |
| MySQL Version 5.7 | [5.7.44](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.7/en/news-5-7-44.html) |
| MySQL Version 8.0 | [8.0.37](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/8.0/en/news-8-0-37.html) |
| MySQL Version 8.4 | [8.4.2](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/8.4/en/news-8-4-2.html) |
| MySQL Version 9.1 | [9.1.0](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/9.1/en/news-9-1-0.html) |

## Major version support

Azure Database for MySQL supports each major version of MySQL from the date Azure begins supporting it until the MySQL community retires it, as provided in the [versioning policy](https://www.mysql.com/support/eol-notice.html).

## Innovation release version support

The MySQL Innovation Release versions are provided to enable access to the latest MySQL features and capabilities. Support for these versions includes core functionalities, but excludes advanced features such as High Availability (HA), replicas, and automated backups. Innovation Release support is limited to the most current version, with previous versions not retained to ensure users have access to the newest advancements. Each Innovation Release server has a 30-day lifecycle from the date of creation, after which it is automatically removed. No monthly maintenance updates are applied during the lifecycle of these versions.

## Minor version support

Azure Database for MySQL automatically performs minor version upgrades to the Azure-preferred version as part of periodic maintenance.

## Major version retirement policy

The retirement details for MySQL major versions are listed in the following table. Dates shown follow the [MySQL versioning policy](https://www.mysql.com/support/eol-notice.html).

### FAQs

__Q: What is the process for upgrading the Azure database for MySQL - Flexible server from version v5.7 to v8.0?__

A: Starting May 2023, Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server enables you to carry out an in-place upgrade from MySQL v5.7 to v8.0 utilizing the Major Version Upgrade (MVU) feature. Consult the [Major version upgrade in Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server](flexible-server/how-to-upgrade.md) document for more detailed information.

__Q: Are there any expected downtime or performance impacts during the upgrade process?__

A: Yes, it's expected that there will be some downtime during the upgrade process. The specific duration varies depending on factors such as the size and complexity of the database. We advise conducting a test upgrade on a nonproduction environment to assess the expected downtime and evaluate the potential performance. Suppose you minimize downtime for your applications during the upgrade. In that case, you can explore the option of [perform minimal downtime major version upgrade from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0 using read replica](flexible-server/how-to-upgrade.md#perform-minimal-downtime-major-version-upgrade-from-mysql-57-to-mysql-80-using-read-replicas).

__Q: Can I roll back to MySQL v5.7 after upgrading to v8.0?__

A: While it's not recommended to downgrade from MySQL v8.0 to v5.7, as the latter is nearing its End of Life status, we acknowledge that there might be specific scenarios where this flexibility becomes necessary. To ensure a smooth upgrade process and alleviate any potential concerns, it's advised to adhere to best practices by performing a comprehensive [on-demand backup](flexible-server/how-to-trigger-on-demand-backup.md) before proceeding with the upgrade to MySQL v8.0. This backup serves as a precautionary measure, allowing you to [restore your database](flexible-server/how-to-restore-server-portal.md) to its previous version on to another new Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server for any unexpected issues or complications with MySQL v8.0.

__Q: What are the main advantages of upgrading to MySQL v8.0?__

A: MySQL v8.0 comes with a host of improvements, including a more efficient data dictionary, enhanced security, and other features like common table expressions and window functions. For details, refer to [MySQL 8.0 release notes](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/8.0/en/news-8-0-32.html)

__Q: Are there any compatibility issues to be aware of when upgrading to MySQL v8.0?__

A: Changes in MySQL v8.0 might cause some compatibility issues. It's important to test your applications with MySQL v8.0 before upgrading the production database.

__Q: What will happen to the server 5.7 after Sep 2025?__

A: You refer to our [retired MySQL version support policy](concepts-version-policy.md#retired-mysql-engine-versions-not-supported-in-azure-database-for-mysql) to learn what will happen after Azure Database for MySQL 5.7 end of support

## Retired MySQL engine versions not supported in Azure Database for MySQL

After the retirement date for each MySQL database version, if you continue running the retired version, note the following restrictions:

As the community won't release any further bug fixes or security fixes, Azure Database for MySQL won't patch the retired database engine for any bugs or security issues or otherwise take security measures regarding it. However, Azure continues performing periodic maintenance and patching for the host, OS, containers, and other service-related components.
- If any support issue you might experience relates to the MySQL database, we might be unable to assist you. In such cases, you must upgrade your database for us to provide you with any support.
- You won't be able to create new database servers for the retired version. However, you can perform point-in-time recoveries and create read replicas for your existing servers.
- New service capabilities developed by Azure Database for MySQL might only be available to supported database server versions.
- Uptime S.L.A.s apply solely to Azure Database for MySQL service-related issues and not to any downtime caused by database engine-related bugs.
In the extreme event of a serious threat to the service caused by the MySQL database engine vulnerability identified in the retired database version, Azure might choose to stop the compute node of your database server from securing the service first. You're asked to upgrade the server before bringing it online. During the upgrade process, your data is always protected using automatic backups performed on the service, which can be used to restore to the older version if desired.
