# Healthcare solutions with Azure DocumentDB

Azure DocumentDB lets healthcare organizations securely manage patient data, speed up innovation, and scale to meet growing demands. Its flexible schema and global distribution support electronic health records, IoT medical devices, and advanced analytics.

Healthcare providers use Azure DocumentDB to improve patient outcomes, streamline operations, and comply with regulatory requirements for data privacy and security.

## Scenarios

Azure DocumentDB supports various healthcare scenarios, including:

### Electronic Health Record (EHR) Management

Storing and using patient records efficiently is critical for healthcare providers. Azure DocumentDB offers a secure, scalable platform for EHR data, letting clinicians access information in real time and support interoperability.

A typical solution uses these components:

- Azure DocumentDB for EHR storage
- Azure API Management for secure data access
- Microsoft Entra ID for identity and access control.

### Remote patient Monitoring and Internet of Things (IoT)

Healthcare organizations increasingly use IoT devices to monitor patient health remotely. Azure DocumentDB ingests and stores device data, letting clinicians analyze data in real time and provide proactive care.

A typical architecture uses Azure DocumentDB for data storage, Azure IoT Hub for device connectivity, and Azure Stream Analytics for real-time data processing.
