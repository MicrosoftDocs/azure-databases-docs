# IoT and manufacturing solutions with Azure DocumentDB

Azure DocumentDB is a flexible, scalable platform for IoT and manufacturing solutions. It handles high-velocity data and supports global distribution, so you can manage device data, predictive maintenance, and smart factory operations.

Use Azure DocumentDB to unify device data, run real-time analytics, and optimize production processes.

## Scenarios

Azure DocumentDB is well suited for several IoT and manufacturing scenarios, like:

### Device data ingestion and analysis

IoT devices generate large volumes of data that you need to ingest, store, and analyze efficiently. Azure DocumentDB lets you scale storage and query device data, so you can support real-time dashboards and alerts.

A typical solution uses Azure DocumentDB for data storage, Azure IoT Hub for device connectivity, and Azure Stream Analytics for processing and visualization.

### Predictive maintenance

Manufacturers reduce downtime and costs by predicting equipment failures before they happen. Azure DocumentDB stores sensor data and maintenance logs, so machine learning models can forecast issues and schedule repairs.

A typical architecture uses Azure DocumentDB for data storage, Azure Machine Learning for predictive analytics, and Azure Functions for automated workflows.
