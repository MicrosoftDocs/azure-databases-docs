# Telecom and media solutions with Azure DocumentDB

Azure DocumentDB lets telecom and media companies build next-generation platforms for content delivery, customer engagement, and network management. Its global distribution and low-latency access support high-throughput workloads and real-time analytics.

Telecom and media organizations use Azure DocumentDB to deliver personalized experiences, optimize network operations, and scale to meet demand spikes.

## Scenarios

Azure DocumentDB is ideal for several telecom and media scenarios, like:

### Real-time content personalization

Media platforms need rapid personalization of content for millions of users. Azure DocumentDB stores user profiles, preferences, and activity data, so you get dynamic recommendations and targeted advertising.

A typical solution uses Azure DocumentDB for profile storage, Azure Cognitive Services for recommendation engines, and Azure Functions for event-driven updates.

### Network monitoring and analytics

Telecom providers need to monitor network performance and detect anomalies in real time. Azure DocumentDB ingests and stores network metrics, so you get dashboards and automated alerts.

A typical architecture uses Azure DocumentDB for data storage, Azure Stream Analytics for real-time processing, and Azure Logic Apps for workflow automation.
