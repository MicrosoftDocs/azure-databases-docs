# Logistics, supply chain, retail, and e-commerce solutions with Azure DocumentDB

Azure DocumentDB lets retailers and supply chain organizations build reliable, scalable platforms for inventory management, personalized shopping, and real-time analytics. Its flexible data model and global distribution support omnichannel experiences and operational efficiency.

Use Azure DocumentDB to unify data across stores, warehouses, and online channels. Rapidly innovate and improve customer satisfaction.

## Scenarios

Azure DocumentDB works well for different retail and supply chain scenarios, like:

### Real-time inventory management

Retailers need accurate, up-to-date inventory data across multiple locations. Azure DocumentDB lets you track and query inventory in real time, so you can automate replenishment and forecast demand.

A typical solution uses Azure DocumentDB for inventory storage, Azure Logic Apps for workflow automation, and Azure Synapse Analytics for demand analysis.
