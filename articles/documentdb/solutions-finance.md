# Financial services and technology solutions with Azure DocumentDB

Azure DocumentDB lets financial institutions build secure, scalable, and modern solutions for banking, insurance, and fintech. Its globally distributed architecture and flexible data model support mission-critical workloads and regulatory compliance.

Financial organizations use Azure DocumentDB to modernize legacy systems, improve customer experiences, and accelerate innovation while maintaining high security and reliability standards.

## Scenarios

Azure DocumentDB works in different financial scenarios, including:

### Real-time fraud detection

Financial institutions need to quickly detect and respond to fraudulent activity. Azure DocumentDB ingests and analyzes transactional data in real time, so machine learning models can flag suspicious patterns and trigger alerts.

The solution uses Azure DocumentDB for data storage, Azure Machine Learning for model training and inference, and Azure Functions for event-driven processing. Integration with Azure Event Hubs lets you scale data ingestion from multiple sources.

### Customer 360 and personalization

Banks and insurers want to deliver personalized experiences by combining customer data from different channels. Azure DocumentDB gives you a unified data platform for storing profiles, transactions, and interactions, so you can run advanced analytics and targeted recommendations.

A typical architecture uses Azure DocumentDB for unified data storage, Azure Synapse Analytics for data integration and analysis, and Azure Logic Apps for workflow automation.
