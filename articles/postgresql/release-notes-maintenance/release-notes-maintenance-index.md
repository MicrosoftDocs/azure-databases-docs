# Azure Database for PostgreSQL – Maintenance release notes index

Welcome to the centralized index of maintenance release notes for **Azure Database for PostgreSQL**. This page provides a year-by-year overview of all published maintenance release notes, helping you stay informed about platform updates, feature enhancements, and bug fixes.

> [!NOTE]
> Each release note typically applies to servers **created after a specific date**, which the document clearly mentions. However, due to Azure’s **region-by-region deployment model**, the actual rollout can span up to a month globally. Read the deployment notes carefully.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - **Server creation date**: Each release note typically applies to servers **created after a specific date**, which the release note mentions.
>
> - **Region-by-region rollout**: Azure deploys updates **region by region**, so some regions receive the update **before** the stated date. In such cases, servers created **before the mentioned date** are already on the new version.
>
> - **Existing servers**: For existing servers, the update is applied **after the release note is published**, during the next scheduled **maintenance window**.
>
> - **Maintenance notifications**: These notifications include a **link to the relevant release note**, so you can verify what changes are included.
