# Supported versions of PostgreSQL in Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server

Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server currently supports the following major versions.

## PostgreSQL version 18 (Preview)

PostgreSQL 18 is now available in **Preview** on Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server. The preview is initially limited to the **East Asia** region, with additional regions coming in the following weeks. For a list of new features and improvements, refer to the [PostgreSQL 18 release notes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/release-18.html).

### Limitations with PostgreSQL 18 Preview

- Microsoft Entra ID authentication is not supported in this preview release.

## PostgreSQL version 10 and older

We don't support PostgreSQL version 10 and older for Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server.

## Managing upgrades

The PostgreSQL project regularly issues minor releases to fix reported bugs. Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server automatically patches servers with minor releases during the service's monthly deployments.

It's also possible to do in-place major version upgrades by using the [major version upgrade](concepts-major-version-upgrade.md) feature. This feature greatly simplifies the upgrade process of an instance from a major version (PostgreSQL 11, for example) to any higher supported version (like PostgreSQL 16).

## Supportability and retirement policy of the underlying operating system

Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server is a fully managed open-source database. The underlying operating system is an integral part of the service. Microsoft continually works to ensure ongoing security updates and maintenance for security compliance and vulnerability mitigation, whether a partner or an internal vendor provides them. Automatic upgrades during scheduled maintenance help keep your managed database secure, stable, and up to date.

## Managing PostgreSQL engine defects

Microsoft has a team of committers and contributors who work full time on the open-source Postgres project and are long-term members of the community. Our contributions include features, performance enhancements, bug fixes, and security patches, among other things. Our open-source team also incorporates feedback from our Azure fleet (and customers) when prioritizing work. But keep in mind that the Postgres project has its own independent contribution guidelines, review process, and release schedule.

When we identify a defect with PostgreSQL engine, we take immediate action to mitigate the problem. If it requires code change, we fix the defect to address the production issue, if possible. We work with the community to incorporate the fix as quickly as possible.
