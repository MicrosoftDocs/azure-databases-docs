# Integrate Azure AI capabilities into Azure Database for PostgreSQL

The `azure_ai` extension adds the ability to use [large language models (LLMs)](/training/modules/fundamentals-generative-ai/3-language%20models) and build [generative AI](/training/paths/introduction-generative-ai/) applications within an Azure Database for PostgreSQL database by integrating the power of [Azure AI services](/azure/ai-services/what-are-ai-services).

Generative AI is a form of artificial intelligence in which LLMs are trained to generate original content based on natural language input. By using the `azure_ai` extension, you can use generative AI's capabilities for processing natural language queries directly from the database.

This article showcases adding rich AI capabilities to an Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance by using the `azure_ai` extension. It shows how you can integrate both [Azure OpenAI](/azure/ai-services/openai/overview) and the [Azure AI Language service](/azure/ai-services/language-service/) into your database by using the extension.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).

- Access granted to Azure OpenAI in the desired Azure subscription. Currently, the application grants access to this service. You can apply for access to Azure OpenAI by completing the form in [Limited access for Azure OpenAI Service](https://aka.ms/oai/access).

- An Azure OpenAI resource with the `text-embedding-ada-002` (version 2) model deployed. This model is currently available only in [certain regions](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models#model-summary-table-and-region-availability). If you don't have a resource, the process for creating one is documented in the [Azure OpenAI resource deployment guide](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource).

- An [Azure AI Language](/azure/ai-services/language-service/overview) resource. If you don't have a Language resource, you can [create one](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics) in the Azure portal by following the instructions provided in the [quickstart for summarization](/azure/ai-services/language-service/summarization/custom/quickstart#create-a-new-resource-from-the-azure-portal). You can use the free pricing tier (`Free F0`) to try the service and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.

- An Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance in your Azure subscription. If you don't have this resource, see [Create an Azure Database for PostgreSQL](quickstart-create-server.md).

## Connect to the database by using psql in Azure Cloud Shell

Open [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/) in a web browser. Select **Bash** as the environment. If you're prompted, select the subscription that you used for your Azure Database for PostgreSQL database, and then select **Create storage**.

To retrieve the database connection details:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), go to your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance.

1. On the left menu, under **Settings**, select **Connect**. Copy the **Connection details** block.

1. Paste the copied declaration lines for environment variables into the Azure Cloud Shell terminal. Replace the `{your-password}` token with the password that you set when you created the database.

    ```bash
    export PGHOST={your-server-name}.postgresql.database.azure.com
    export PGUSER={your-user-name}
    export PGPORT=5432
    export PGDATABASE={your-database-name}
    export PGPASSWORD="{your-password}"
    ```

1. Connect to your database by using the [psql command-line tool](https://www.postgresguide.com/utilities/psql/). Enter the following command at the prompt:

    ```bash
    psql
    ```

## Install the azure_ai extension

You can use the `azure_ai` extension to integrate Azure OpenAI and Azure Cognitive Services into your database. For more information, see [Generate vector embeddings with Azure OpenAI in Azure Database for PostgreSQL](generative-ai-azure-openai.md).

To enable the extension in your database:

1. Add the extension to your allowlist, as described in [Allow extensions](../extensions/how-to-allow-extensions.md#allow-extensions).

1. In the database in which you plan to use the `azure_ai` extension, install the extension as described in [Create extensions](../extensions/how-to-create-extensions.md).

## Inspect the objects in the azure_ai extension

Reviewing the objects that the `azure_ai` extension contains can provide a better understanding of the capabilities that it offers. You can use the [`\dx` meta-command](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html#APP-PSQL-META-COMMAND-DX-LC) from the `psql` command prompt to list the objects in the extension:

```psql
\dx+ azure_ai
```

The meta-command output shows that the `azure_ai` extension creates three schemas, multiple user-defined functions (UDFs), and several composite types in the database. The following table describes the schemas that the extension adds:

| Schema | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `azure_ai` | Provides the principal schema where the configuration table and UDFs for interacting with it reside. |
| `azure_openai` | Contains the UDFs that enable calling an Azure OpenAI endpoint. |
| `azure_cognitive` | Provides UDFs and composite types related to integrating the database with Azure Cognitive Services. |

The functions and types are all associated with one of the schemas. To review the functions defined in the `azure_ai` schema, use the `\df` meta-command. Specify the schema whose functions should be displayed. The `\x auto` commands before the `\df` command turn the expanded display on and off automatically, to make the output from the command easier to view in Azure Cloud Shell.

```sql
\x auto
\df+ azure_ai.*
```

Use the `azure_ai.set_setting()` function to set the endpoint and critical values for Azure AI services. It accepts a *key* and the *value* to assign it. The `azure_ai.get_setting()` function provides a way to retrieve the values that you set with the `set_setting()` function. It accepts the key of the setting that you want to view. For both methods, the key must be one of the following:

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `azure_openai.endpoint` | A supported Azure OpenAI endpoint (for example, `https://example.openai.azure.com`). |
| `azure_openai.subscription_key` | A subscription key for an Azure OpenAI resource. |
| `azure_cognitive.endpoint` | A supported Cognitive Services endpoint (for example, `https://example.cognitiveservices.azure.com`). |
| `azure_cognitive.subscription_key` | A subscription key for a Cognitive Services resource. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because the connection information for Azure AI services, including API keys, is stored in a configuration table in the database, the `azure_ai` extension defines a role called `azure_ai_settings_manager` to help ensure that this information is protected and accessible only to users who have that role. This role enables reading and writing of settings related to the extension.
>
> Only superusers and members of the `azure_ai_settings_manager` role can invoke the `azure_ai.get_setting()` and `azure_ai.set_setting()` functions. In Azure Database for PostgreSQL, all admin users have the `azure_ai_settings_manager` role.

## Generate vector embeddings with Azure OpenAI

The `azure_ai` extension's `azure_openai` schema enables the use of Azure OpenAI for creating vector embeddings for text values. By using this schema, you can [generate embeddings with Azure OpenAI](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/embeddings) directly from the database to create vector representations of input text. These representations can then be used in vector similarity searches and consumed by machine learning models.

Embeddings are a technique of using machine learning models to evaluate how closely related information is. This technique allows for efficient identification of relationships and similarities between data, so that algorithms can identify patterns and make accurate predictions.

### Set the Azure OpenAI endpoint and key

Before you use the `azure_openai` functions, configure the extension with your Azure OpenAI service endpoint and key:

1. In the Azure portal, go to your Azure OpenAI resource. On the left menu, under **Resource Management**, select **Keys and Endpoint**.

1. Copy your endpoint and access key. You can use either `KEY1` or `KEY2`. Always having two keys allows you to securely rotate and regenerate keys without causing service disruption.

1. In the following command, replace the `{endpoint}` and `{api-key}` tokens with values that you retrieved from the Azure portal. Then run the commands from the `psql` command prompt to add your values to the configuration table.

   ```sql
   SELECT azure_ai.set_setting('azure_openai.endpoint','{endpoint}');
   SELECT azure_ai.set_setting('azure_openai.subscription_key', '{api-key}');
   ```

1. Verify the settings written in the configuration table:

   ```sql
   SELECT azure_ai.get_setting('azure_openai.endpoint');
   SELECT azure_ai.get_setting('azure_openai.subscription_key');
   ```

The `azure_ai` extension is now connected to your Azure OpenAI account and ready to generate vector embeddings.

### Populate the database with sample data

This article uses a small subset of the [BillSum dataset](https://github.com/FiscalNote/BillSum) to provide sample text data for generating vectors. This dataset provides a list of United States congressional and California state bills. You can download the `bill_sum_data.csv` file that contains this data from the [GitHub repo for Azure samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Azure-OpenAI-Docs-Samples/blob/main/Samples/Tutorials/Embeddings/data/bill_sum_data.csv).

To host the sample data in the database, create a table named `bill_summaries`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE bill_summaries
(
    id bigint PRIMARY KEY,
    bill_id text,
    bill_text text,
    summary text,
    title text,
    text_len bigint,
    sum_len bigint
);
```

By using the PostgreSQL [COPY command](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html) from the `psql` command prompt, load the sample data from the CSV file into the `bill_summaries` table. Specify that the first row of the CSV file is a header row.

```sql
\COPY bill_summaries (id, bill_id, bill_text, summary, title, text_len, sum_len) FROM PROGRAM 'curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/Azure-OpenAI-Docs-Samples/main/Samples/Tutorials/Embeddings/data/bill_sum_data.csv"' WITH CSV HEADER ENCODING 'UTF8'
```

### Enable vector support

You can use the `azure_ai` extension to generate embeddings for input text. To enable the generated vectors to be stored alongside the rest of your data in the database, you must install the `pgvector` extension. Follow the guidance in the [documentation about enabling vector support in your database](/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/how-to-use-pgvector#enable-extension).

With vector support added to your database, add a new column to the `bill_summaries` table by using the `vector` data type to store embeddings within the table. The `text-embedding-ada-002` model produces vectors with 1,536 dimensions, so you must specify `1536` as the vector size.

```sql
ALTER TABLE bill_summaries
ADD COLUMN bill_vector vector(1536);
```

### Generate and store vectors

The `bill_summaries` table is now ready to store embeddings. By using the `azure_openai.create_embeddings()` function, you create vectors for the `bill_text` field and insert them into the newly created `bill_vector` column in the `bill_summaries` table.

Before you use the `create_embeddings()` function, run the following command to inspect it and review the required arguments:

```sql
\df+ azure_openai.*
```

The `Argument data types` property in the output of the `\df+ azure_openai.*` command reveals the list of arguments that the function expects:

| Argument | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `deployment_name` | `text` | | Name of the deployment in the Azure AI Foundry portal that contains the `text-embeddings-ada-002` model. |
| `input` | `text` | | Input text used to create embeddings. |
| `timeout_ms` | `integer` | `3600000` | Timeout in milliseconds, after which the operation is stopped. |
| `throw_on_error` | `boolean` | `true` | Flag that indicates whether the function should, on error, throw an exception that results in a rollback of the wrapping transactions. |

The first argument is the `deployment_name` value, which was assigned when your embedding model was deployed in your Azure OpenAI account. To retrieve this value:

1. Go to your Azure OpenAI resource in the Azure portal.

1. On the left menu, under **Resource Management**, select **Model deployments** to open the Azure AI Foundry portal.

1. In the Azure AI Foundry portal, select **Deployments**. On the **Deployments** pane, copy the **Deployment name** value that's associated with the `text-embedding-ada-002` model deployment.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-integrate-azure-ai/azure-open-ai-studio-deployments-embeddings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of embedding deployments for integrating AI.":::

By using this information, run a query to update each record in the `bill_summaries` table. Insert the generated vector embeddings for the `bill_text` field into the `bill_vector` column by using the `azure_openai.create_embeddings()` function. Replace `{your-deployment-name}` with the **Deployment name** value that you copied from the Azure AI Foundry portal's **Deployments** pane. Then run the following command:

```sql
UPDATE bill_summaries b
SET bill_vector = azure_openai.create_embeddings('{your-deployment-name}', b.bill_text);
```

Run the following query to view the embedding that's generated for the first record in the table. You can run `\x` first if the output is difficult to read.

```sql
SELECT bill_vector FROM bill_summaries LIMIT 1;
```

Each embedding is a vector of floating-point numbers. The distance between two embeddings in the vector space is correlated with semantic similarity between two inputs in the original format.

### Perform a vector similarity search

Vector similarity is a method for measuring how similar two items are by representing them as vectors. Vectors are a series of numbers. They're often used to perform searches via LLMs.

Vector similarity is commonly calculated through distance metrics, such as:

- **Euclidean distance**: Measures the straight-line distance between two vectors in the *n*-dimensional space.
- **Cosine similarity**: Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors.

Enable more efficient searching over the `vector` field by creating an index on `bill_summaries` via cosine distance and [Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW)](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector#hnsw). HNSW allows `pgvector` to use the latest graph-based algorithms to approximate nearest-neighbor queries.

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON bill_summaries USING hnsw (bill_vector vector_cosine_ops);
```

With everything now in place, you're ready to execute a [cosine similarity](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/understand-embeddings#cosine-similarity) search query against the database.

In the following query, the embeddings are generated for an input question and then cast to a vector array (`::vector`). The vector array allows the question to be compared against the vectors stored in the `bill_summaries` table.

```sql
SELECT bill_id, title FROM bill_summaries
ORDER BY bill_vector <=> azure_openai.create_embeddings('embeddings', 'Show me bills relating to veterans entrepreneurship.')::vector
LIMIT 3;
```

The query uses the `<=>` [vector operator](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector#vector-operators). This operator represents the cosine distance operator that's used to calculate the distance between two vectors in a multidimensional space.

## Integrate Azure Cognitive Services

The Azure AI services integrations included in the `azure_cognitive` schema of the `azure_ai` extension provide a rich set of AI language features that you can access directly from the database. The functionalities include sentiment analysis, language detection, key phrase extraction, entity recognition, and text summarization. Access to these capabilities is enabled through the [Azure AI Language service](/azure/ai-services/language-service/overview).

To review the complete Azure AI capabilities that you can access through the extension, see [Integrate Azure Database for PostgreSQL with Azure Cognitive Services](generative-ai-azure-cognitive.md).

### Set the Azure AI Language service endpoint and key

As with the `azure_openai` functions, to successfully make calls against Azure AI services by using the `azure_ai` extension, you must provide the endpoint and a key for your Azure AI Language service resource:

1. In the Azure portal, go to your Language service resource.

1. On the left menu, under **Resource Management**, select **Keys and Endpoint**.

1. Copy your endpoint and access key. You can use either `KEY1` or `KEY2`.

1. In the `psql` command prompt, run the following commands to add your values to the configuration table. Replace the `{endpoint}` and `{api-key}` tokens with the values that you retrieved from the Azure portal.

   ```sql
   SELECT azure_ai.set_setting('azure_cognitive.endpoint','{endpoint}');
   SELECT azure_ai.set_setting('azure_cognitive.subscription_key', '{api-key}');
   ```

### Summarize bills

To demonstrate some of the capabilities of the `azure_cognitive` functions of the `azure_ai` extension, you can generate a summary of each bill. The `azure_cognitive` schema provides two functions for summarizing text:

- `summarize_abstractive`: Abstractive summarization produces a summary that captures the main concepts from input text but might not use identical words.
- `summarize_extractive`: Extractive summarization assembles a summary by extracting critical sentences from the input text.

To use the Azure AI Language service's ability to generate new, original content, you use the `summarize_abstractive` function to create a summary of text input. Use the `\df` meta-command from `psql` again, this time to look specifically at the `azure_cognitive.summarize_abstractive` function:

```sql
\df azure_cognitive.summarize_abstractive
```

The `Argument data types` property in the output of the `\df azure_cognitive.summarize_abstractive` command reveals the list of arguments that the function expects:

| Argument | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `text` | `text` | | Input text to summarize. |
| `language` | `text` | | Two-letter ISO 639-1 representation of the language in which the input text is written. For allowed values, check [Language support for Language features](/azure/ai-services/language-service/concepts/language-support). |
| `timeout_ms` | `integer` | `3600000` | Timeout in milliseconds, after which the operation is stopped. |
| `throw_on_error` | `boolean` | `true` | Flag that indicates whether the function should, on error, throw an exception that results in a rollback of the wrapping transactions. |
| `sentence_count` | `integer` | `3` | Maximum number of sentences to include in the generated summary. |
| `disable_service_logs` | `boolean` | `false` | Setting that disables Language service logs. The Language service logs your input text for 48 hours solely to allow for troubleshooting issues. Setting this property to `true` disables input logging and might limit our ability to investigate issues that occur. For more information, see the [Cognitive Services compliance and privacy notes](https://aka.ms/cs-compliance) and the [Microsoft Responsible AI principles](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai). |

The `summarize_abstractive` function requires the following arguments: `azure_cognitive.summarize_abstractive(text TEXT, language TEXT)`.

The following query against the `bill_summaries` table uses the `summarize_abstractive` function to generate a new one-sentence summary for the text of a bill. It allows you to incorporate the power of generative AI directly into your queries.

```sql
SELECT
    bill_id,
    azure_cognitive.summarize_abstractive(bill_text, 'en', sentence_count => 1) one_sentence_summary
FROM bill_summaries
WHERE bill_id = '112_hr2873';
```

You can also use the function to write data into your database tables. Modify the `bill_summaries` table to add a new column for storing the one-sentence summaries in the database:

```sql
ALTER TABLE bill_summaries
ADD COLUMN one_sentence_summary TEXT;
```

Next, update the table with the summaries. The `summarize_abstractive` function returns an array of text (`text[]`). The `array_to_string` function converts the return value to its string representation. In the following query, the `throw_on_error` argument is set to `false`. This setting allows the summarization process to continue if an error occurs.

```sql
UPDATE bill_summaries b
SET one_sentence_summary = array_to_string(azure_cognitive.summarize_abstractive(b.bill_text, 'en', throw_on_error => false, sentence_count => 1), ' ', '')
where one_sentence_summary is NULL;
```

In the output, you might notice a warning about an invalid document for which an appropriate summarization couldn't be generated. This warning results from setting `throw_on_error` to `false` in the preceding query. If you left that flag to the default of `true`, the query would fail, and no summaries would be written to the database. To view the record that threw the warning, run this command:

```sql
SELECT bill_id, one_sentence_summary FROM bill_summaries WHERE one_sentence_summary is NULL;
```

You can then query the `bill_summaries` table to view the new, one-sentence summaries that the `azure_ai` extension generates for the other records in the table:

```sql
SELECT bill_id, one_sentence_summary FROM bill_summaries LIMIT 5;
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You just learned how to use the `azure_ai` extension to integrate large language models and generative AI capabilities into your database.
