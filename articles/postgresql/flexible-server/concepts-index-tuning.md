# Index tuning in Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-postgresql-flexible-server](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/postgresql/includes/applies-to-postgresql-flexible-server.md)]

Index tuning is a feature in Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server that automatically improves the performance of your workload by analyzing the tracked queries and providing index recommendations.

It's a built-in offering in Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server, which builds on top of [Monitor performance with query store](concepts-query-store.md) functionality. Index tuning analyzes the workload tracked by query store and produces index recommendations to improve the performance of the analyzed workload or to drop duplicate or unused indexes.

- [Identify which indexes are beneficial](#create-index-recommendations) to create because they could significantly improve the queries analyzed during an index tuning session.
- [Identify indexes that are exact duplicates and can be eliminated](#drop-duplicate-indexes) to reduce the performance impact their existence and maintenance have on the system's overall performance.
- [Identify indexes not used in a configurable period](#drop-unused-indexes) that could be candidates to eliminate.

## General description of the index tuning algorithm

When the `index_tuning.mode` server parameter is configured to `report`, tuning sessions are automatically started with the frequency configured in server parameter `index_tuning.analysis_interval`, expressed in minutes.

In the first phase, the tuning session searches for the list of databases in which it considers that whatever recommendations it might produce might significantly impact the overall performance of the system. To do so, it collects all queries recorded by query store whose executions were captured within the lookup interval this tuning session is focusing on. The lookup interval currently spans to the past `index_tuning.analysis_interval` minutes, from the starting time of the tuning session.

For all user-initiated queries with executions recorded in [query store](concepts-query-store.md) and whose runtime statistics aren't [reset](concepts-query-store.md#query_storeqs_reset), the system ranks them based on their aggregated total execution time. It focuses its attention on the most prominent queries, based on their duration.

The following queries are excluded from that list:
- System-initiated queries. (that is, queries executed by `azuresu` role)
- Queries executed in the context of any system database (`azure_sys`, `template0`, `template1`, and `azure_maintenance`).

The algorithm iterates over the target databases, searching for possible indexes that could improve the performance of analyzed workloads. It also searches for indexes that can be eliminated because they're identified as duplicates or not used for a configurable period of time.

### CREATE INDEX recommendations

For each database identified as a candidate to analyze for producing index recommendations, all SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE queries executed during the lookup interval and in the context of that specific database are factored in.

The resulting set of queries is ranked based on their aggregated total execution time, and the top `index_tuning.max_queries_per_database` is analyzed for possible index recommendations.

Potential recommendations aim to improve the performance of these types of queries:
- Queries with filters (that is, queries with predicates in the WHERE clause),
- Queries joining multiple relations, whether they follow the syntax in which joins are expressed with JOIN clause or whether the join predicates are expressed in the WHERE clause.
- Queries combining filters and join predicates.
- Queries with grouping (queries with a GROUP BY clause).
- Queries combining filters and grouping.
- Queries with sorting (queries with an ORDER BY clause).
- Queries combining filters and sorting.

> [!NOTE]
> The only type of indexes the system currently recommends are those of type [B-Tree](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-types.html#INDEXES-TYPES-BTREE).

If a query references one column of a table and that table has no statistics, it skips the whole query and doesn't produce any index recommendations to improve its execution.

Analysis required to gather statistics can be triggered manually using the ANALYZE command or automatically by the autovacuum daemon.

`index_tuning.max_indexes_per_table` specifies the number of indexes that can be recommended, excluding any indexes that might already exist on the table for any single table referenced by any number of queries during a tuning session.

`index_tuning.max_index_count` specifies the number of index recommendations produced for all tables of any database analyzed during a tuning session.

For an index recommendation to be emitted, the tuning engine must estimate that it improves at least one query in the analyzed workload by a factor specified with `index_tuning.min_improvement_factor`.

Likewise, all index recommendations are checked to ensure that they don't introduce regression on any single query in that workload of a factor specified with `index_tuning.max_regression_factor`.

> [!NOTE]
> `index_tuning.min_improvement_factor` and `index_tuning.max_regression_factor` both refer to cost of query plans, not to their duration or the resources they consume during execution.

All the parameters mentioned in the previous paragraphs, their default values and valid ranges are described in [configuration options](how-to-configure-index-tuning.md#configuration-options).

The script produced along with the recommendation to create an index, follows this pattern:

`create index concurrently {indexName} on {schema}.{table}({column_name}[, ...])`

It includes the clause `concurrently`. For further information about the effects of this clause, visit PostgreSQL official documentation for [CREATE INDEX](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createindex.html#SQL-CREATEINDEX-CONCURRENTLY).

Index tuning automatically generates the names of the recommended indexes, which typically consist of the names of the different key columns separated by "_" (underscores) and with a constant "_idx" suffix. If the total length of the name exceeds PostgreSQL limits or if it clashes with any existing relations, the name is slightly different. It could be truncated, and a number could be appended to the end of the name.

#### Compute the impact of a CREATE INDEX recommendation

The impact of creating an index recommendation is measured on IndexSize (megabytes) and QueryCostImprovement (percentage).

IndexSize is a single value that represents the estimated size of the index, considering the current cardinality of the table and the size of the columns referenced by the recommended index.

QueryCostImprovement consists of an array of values, where each element represents the improvement in the plan's cost for each query whose plan's cost is estimated to improve if this index existed. Each element shows the query's identifier (queried) and the percentage by which the plan's cost would improve if the recommendation were implemented (dimensional).

### DROP INDEX and REINDEX recommendations

For each database for which index tuning functionality is determined, it should initiate a new session, and after the CREATE INDEX recommendations phase completes, it recommends dropping or reindexing existing indexes, based on the following criteria:
- Drop if it's considered duplicate of others.
- Drop if it isn't used for a configurable amount of time.
- Reindex indexes which are marked as invalid.

#### Drop duplicate indexes

Recommendations for dropping duplicate indexes: First, identify which indexes have duplicates.

Duplicates are ranked based on different functions that can be attributed to the index and based on their estimated sizes.

Finally, it recommends dropping all duplicates with a lower ranking than its reference leader and describes why each duplicate was ranked the way it was.

For two indexes to be considered duplicate they must:
- Be created over the same table.
- Be an index of the exact same type.
- Match their key columns and, for multi-column index keys, match the order in which they're referenced.
- Match the expression tree of its predicate. Only applicable to partial indexes.
- Match the expression tree of all nonsimple column references. Only applicable to indexes created on expressions.
- Match the collation of each column referenced in the key.

#### Drop unused indexes

Recommendations for dropping unused indexes identify those indexes which:
- Aren't used for at least `index_tuning.unused_min_period` days.
- Show a minimum (daily average) number of `index_tuning.unused_dml_per_table` DMLs on the table where the index is created.
- Show a minimum (daily average) number of `index_tuning.unused_reads_per_table` reads on the table where the index is created.

#### Reindex invalid indexes

Recommendations for reindex existing indexes identify those indexes which are marked as invalid. To learn more about why and when indexes are marked as invalid, refer to the [REINDEX](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-reindex.html#DESCRIPTION) in PostgreSQL official documentation.

#### Compute the impact of a DROP INDEX recommendation

The impact of a drop index recommendation is measured on two dimensions: Benefit (percentage) and IndexSize (megabytes).

The benefit is a single value that can be ignored for now.

IndexSize is a single value that represents the estimated size of the index, considering the current cardinality of the table and the size of the columns referenced by the recommended index.

## Configuring index tuning

Index tuning can be enabled, disabled, and configured through a set of parameters that control its behavior, such as how often a tuning session can run.

Explore all the details about correct configuration of index tuning feature in [how to enable, disable, and configure index tuning](how-to-configure-index-tuning.md).

## Information produced by index tuning

[How to read, interpret and use recommendations produced by index tuning](how-to-get-and-apply-recommendations-from-index-tuning.md) describes in full detail how to obtain and use the recommendations produced by index tuning.

## Limitations and supportability

Following is the list of limitations and supportability scope for index tuning.

### Dependency on hypopg extension

For index tuning to produce CREATE INDEX recommendations, it uses the [hypopg](https://github.com/HypoPG/hypopg/) extension.

If the extension already exists when a tuning session begins, it is used on the schema in which it was created. And when the tuning session finishes, the extension is not dropped. An exception to this is if the extension was created in the `pg_catalog` schema. If that's the case, index tuning drops the extension.

If the extension didn't exist in the first place or we dropped it because it was created in `pg_catalog` schema, index tuning will create it under a schema called `ms_temp_recommendations709253` and, when the tuning session finishes successfully, it drops the extension and removes the schema.

Users who are members of the `azure_pg_admin` role can drop the hypopg extension at any point in time, even when it was created by the index tuning feature. However, dropping it while an index tuning session is running might cause that session to fail and don't produce any recommendations.

### Supported compute tiers and SKUs

Index tuning is supported on all [currently available tiers](concepts-compute.md): Burstable, General Purpose, and Memory Optimized, and on any [currently supported compute SKU](concepts-compute.md) with at least 4 vCores.

### Supported versions of PostgreSQL

Index tuning is supported on [major versions](concepts-supported-versions.md) **12 or greater** of Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server.

### Use of search_path

Index tuning consumes the value persisted in column `search_path` of [query_store.qs_view](concepts-query-store.md#query_storeqs_view), so that when each query is analyzed, the same value of `search_path` that was set when the query executed originally is the one to which it's set to analyze possible recommendations.

### Parameterized queries

Parameterized queries created with [PREPARE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-prepare.html) or using the [extended query protocol](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/protocol-flow.html#PROTOCOL-FLOW-EXT-QUERY) are parsed and analyzed to produce index recommendations on them.

For the analysis of parameterized queries, index tuning requires that [pg_qs.parameters_capture_mode](concepts-query-store.md#configuration-options) is set to `capture_first_sample` when query store captures the execution of the query. It also requires that the parameters are correctly captured by query store when the query is executed. In other words, for the query being analyzed, [query_store.qs_view](concepts-query-store.md#query_storeqs_view) must have its column `parameters_capture_status` set to `succeeded`.

### Read-only mode and read replicas

Because index tuning relies on [query store](concepts-query-store.md), which is [not supported in read replicas or when an instance is in read-only mode](concepts-query-store.md#read-only-mode), we don't support it on read replicas or on instances which are in read-only mode.

Any recommendations seen on a read replica were produced on the primary replica after having analyzed exclusively the workload that executed on the primary replica.

### Scale down of compute

If index tuning is enabled on a server, and you scale down that server's compute to less than the minimum number of required vCores, the feature remains enabled. Because the feature isn't supported on servers with less than 4 vCores, it will not run to analyze the workload and produce recommendations, even if `index_tuning.mode` was set to `ON` when the compute was scaled down. While the server doesn't meet the minimum requirements, all `index_tuning.*` server parameters are inaccessible. Whenever you scale your server back up to a compute that meets the minimum requirements, `index_tuning.mode` is configured with whatever value it was set before you scaled it down to a compute which didn't meet the requirements.

### High availability and read replicas

If you have [high availability](/azure/reliability/reliability-postgresql-flexible-server) or [read replicas](concepts-read-replicas.md) configured on your server, be aware of the implications associated with producing write-intensive workloads on the primary server when implementing the recommended indexes. Be especially careful when creating indexes whose size is estimated to be large.
