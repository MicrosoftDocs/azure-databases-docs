# Azure Confidential Computing for Azure Database for PostgreSQL

[Azure Confidential Computing (ACC)](/azure/confidential-computing/overview) enables organizations to securely process and collaborate on sensitive data, such as personal data or protected health information (PHI). ACC provides built-in protection against unauthorized access by securing data in use through Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This allows for secure real-time analytics and collaborative machine learning across organizational boundaries.

## Understanding the architecture

**Azure Database for PostgreSQL** supports Azure Confidential Computing through Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), which are hardware-based, isolated memory regions within the CPU. Data processed inside the TEE is protected from access by the operating system, hypervisor, or other applications.

- Code runs in plaintext within the TEE but remains encrypted outside the enclave.
- Data is encrypted at rest, in transit, and use.
- Protected from access by the OS, hypervisor, or other applications.

## Processors

**Azure Confidential Computing** is supported in **Azure Database for PostgreSQL** by selecting a supported confidential virtual machine (VM) SKU when creating a new server. There are two processors to choose from:

- AMD SEV-SNP

## Virtual machine SKUs

The SKUs supporting Azure Confidential Computing (ACC) for Azure Database for PostgreSQL are:

| SKU Name | Processor | vCores | Memory (GiB) | Max IOPS | Max I/O Bandwidth (MBps) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Dcadsv5** | AMD SEV-SNP | 2-96 | 8-384 | 3750-80000 | 48-1200 |
| **Ecadsv5** | AMD SEV-SNP | 2-96 | 16-672 | 3750-80000 | 48-1200 |

## Deployment

You can deploy Azure Database for PostgreSQL with ACC using various methods, such as the Azure portal, Azure CLI, ARM templates, Bicep, Terraform, Azure PowerShell, REST API, etc.

For this example, we're using the Azure portal.

Follow the steps below to deploy an [Azure Database for PostgreSQL](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.PostgreSQLFlexibleServer) server:

1. Select **UAE North** as the region.

1. Select **Configure Server** under **Compute + Storage**.

1. On the **Compute and Storage** tab, select your Compute Tier and Compute Processor.

1. Select Compute Size and **select a confidential compute SKU** and the size based on your needs.

1. Deploy your server.

## Compare

Let's compare Azure Confidential Compute virtual machines vs. Azure Confidential Computing.

| Feature | Confidential Compute VMs | ACC for Azure Database for PostgreSQL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hardware root of trust | Yes | Yes |
| Trusted launch | Yes | Yes |
| Memory isolation and encryption | Yes | Yes |
| Secure key management | Yes | Yes |
| [Remote attestation](/azure/confidential-computing/attestation-solutions) | Yes | No |

## Limitations and considerations

Be sure to evaluate the limitations carefully before deploying in a production environment.

- Confidential Computing is only available in the UAE North region and West Europe regions.
- Point-in-time Restore (PITR) from nonconfidential compute SKUs to confidential ones isn't allowed.
