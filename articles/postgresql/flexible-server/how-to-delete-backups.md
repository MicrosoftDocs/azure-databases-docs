# Delete on-demand backups

This article provides step-by-step instructions to delete on-demand backups of an Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On-demand backups are automatically deleted, according to your configured backup retention period. However, you can manually delete them earlier if theyâ€™re no longer needed.

## Steps to delete on-demand backups

### [Portal](#tab/portal-delete-on-demand-backups)

Using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/):

1. Select your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance.

2. In the resource menu, under the **Settings** section, select **Backup and restore**.

3. In **Backup type**, select **On-demand** if you want to only see the on-demand backups which are still available to be restored.

4. Identify the on-demand backup that you want to delete. Then, under the **Actions** column, select **Delete**.

5. A dialog asks for confirmation before the irreversible operation is initiated. Select **Delete** if you want to initiate the permanent deletion of that particular on-demand backup.

6.  A notification informs you that the on-demand backup is being deleted.

7.  Upon successful completion, a notification informs you that the on-demand backup is deleted.

### [CLI](#tab/cli-delete-on-demand-backups)

You can delete any of the currently available on-demand backups of a server via the [az postgres flexible-server backup delete](/cli/azure/postgres/flexible-server/backup#az-postgres-flexible-server-backup-delete) command.

```azurecli-interactive
az postgres flexible-server backup delete \
  --resource-group <resource_group> \
  --name <server> \
  --backup-name <backup>
```

If you run the previous command, it requires you to explicitly confirm, responding with a `y` (yes):

```output
Are you sure you want to delete the backup '<backup>' in server '<server>'
```

If you want to run the command without needing the user interaction, you can add the `--yes` parameter like this:

```azurecli-interactive
az postgres flexible-server backup delete \
  --resource-group <resource_group> \
  --name <server> \
  --backup-name <backup> \
  --yes
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you provide the name that doesn't match any of the available on-demand backups, the command doesn't report any error.
