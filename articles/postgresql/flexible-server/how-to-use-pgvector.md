# Enable and use pgvector in Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-postgresql-flexible-server](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/postgresql/includes/applies-to-postgresql-flexible-server.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Introduction to `pgvector`](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/cosmos-db/postgresql/includes/pgvector-introduction.md)]

## Enable extension

Before you can enable `pgvector` on your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance, you need to add it to your allowlist as described in [how to use PostgreSQL extensions](concepts-extensions.md#how-to-use-postgresql-extensions) and check if correctly added by running `SHOW azure.extensions;`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Notice that although all PostgreSQL community tends to refer to this extension as pgvector, the name of the binary and the extension itself is simply `vector`. Take that into consideration, because that is the name you must use to allowlist it or to create it on any database via the CREATE EXTENSION command.

Then you can install the extension, by connecting to your target database and running the [CREATE EXTENSION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createextension.html) command. You need to repeat the command separately for every database you want the extension to be available in.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION vector;
```

> [!Note]
> To remove the extension from the currently connected database use `DROP EXTENSION vector;`.
