> [!NOTE]
> Azure Database for PostgreSQL supports in-place major version upgrades only to currently supported PostgreSQL versions. For example, you can upgrade the current version given the target version is officially supported by Azure at the time of the upgrade. Unsupported versions can't be selected as upgrade targets, and attempting to upgrade to a deprecated version may result in failure or service disruption. Always consult the [Azure PostgreSQL versioning policy](/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/concepts-version-policy) and [upgrade documentation](/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/concepts-major-version-upgrade) before initiating a major version upgrade.
