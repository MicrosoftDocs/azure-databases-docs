# Tutorial: Create a semantic search with Azure Database for PostgreSQL and Azure OpenAI

This hands-on tutorial shows you how to build a semantic search application by using Azure Database for PostgreSQL and Azure OpenAI.

Semantic search does searches based on semantics. Standard lexical search does searches based on keywords provided in a query. For example, your recipe dataset might not contain labels like gluten-free, vegan, dairy-free, fruit-free, or dessert, but these characteristics can be deduced from the ingredients. The idea is to issue such semantic queries and get relevant search results.

In this tutorial, you:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Identify the search scenarios and the data fields that will be involved in a search.
> - For every data field involved in a search, create a corresponding vector field to store the embeddings of the value stored in the data field.
> - Generate embeddings for the data in the selected data fields and store the embeddings in their corresponding vector fields.
> - Generate the embedding for any input search query.
> - Search for the vector data field and list the nearest neighbors.
> - Run the results through appropriate relevance, ranking, and personalization models to produce the final ranking. In the absence of such models, rank the results in decreasing dot-product order.
> - Monitor the model, results quality, and business metrics, such as click-through rate and dwell time. Incorporate feedback mechanisms to debug and improve the search stack, from data quality, data freshness, and personalization to user experience.

## Prerequisites

1. Create an OpenAI account and [request access to Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/oai/access).
1. Grant access to Azure OpenAI in the desired subscription.
1. Grant permissions toâ€¯[create Azure OpenAI resources and to deploy models](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/role-based-access-control).
1. [Create and deploy an Azure OpenAI resource and a model](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource). Deploy the embeddings model [text-embedding-ada-002](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models#embeddings-models). Copy the deployment name, because you need it to create embeddings.

## Enable the azure_ai and pgvector extensions

Before you can enable `azure_ai` and `pgvector` on your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance, you need to [add them to your allowlist](../extensions/how-to-allow-extensions.md). Make sure that they're correctly added by running `SHOW azure.extensions;`.

Then you can install the extension by connecting to your target database and running the [CREATE EXTENSION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createextension.html) command. You need to repeat the command separately for every database where you want the extension to be available.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION azure_ai;
CREATE EXTENSION vector;
```

## Configure an OpenAI endpoint and key

In Azure AI services, under **Resource Management** > **Keys and Endpoints**, you can find the endpoint and the keys for your Azure AI resource. Use the endpoint and one of the keys to enable the `azure_ai` extension to invoke the model deployment:

```sql
select azure_ai.set_setting('azure_openai.endpoint','https://<endpoint>.openai.azure.com');
select azure_ai.set_setting('azure_openai.subscription_key', '<API Key>');
```

## Download the data

Download the data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/better-recipes-for-a-better-life).

## Create the table

Connect to your server and create a `test` database. In that database, use the following command to create a table in which you'll import data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.recipes(
    rid integer NOT NULL,
    recipe_name text,
    prep_time text,
    cook_time text,
    total_time text,
    servings integer,
    yield text,
    ingredients text,
    directions text,
    rating real,
    url text,
    cuisine_path text,
    nutrition text,
    timing text,
    img_src text,
    PRIMARY KEY (rid)
);
```

## Import the data

Set the following environment variable on the client window to set encoding to UTF-8. This step is necessary because this particular dataset uses Windows-1252 encoding.

```cmd
Rem on Windows
Set PGCLIENTENCODING=utf-8;
```

```bash
# on Unix based operating systems
export PGCLIENTENCODING=utf-8
```

Import the data into the table that you created. Note that this dataset contains a header row.

```bash
psql -d <database> -h <host> -U <user> -c "\copy recipes FROM <local recipe data file> DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER"
```

## Add a column to store the embeddings

Add an embedding column to the table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE recipes ADD COLUMN embedding vector(1536);
```

## Generate embeddings

Generate embeddings for your data by using the `azure_ai` extension. The following example vectorizes a few fields and is concatenated.

```sql
WITH ro AS (
    SELECT ro.rid
    FROM
        recipes ro
    WHERE
        ro.embedding is null
        LIMIT 500
)
UPDATE
    recipes r
SET
    embedding = azure_openai.create_embeddings('text-embedding-ada-002', r.recipe_name||' '||r.cuisine_path||' '||r.ingredients||' '||r.nutrition||' '||r.directions)
FROM
    ro
WHERE
    r.rid = ro.rid;
```

Repeat the command until there are no more rows to process.

> [!TIP]  
> Play around with the `LIMIT` value. With a high value, the statement might fail halfway through due to throttling that Azure OpenAI imposes. If the statement fails, wait for at least one minute and run the command again.

## Search

Create a search function in your database for convenience:

```sql
create function
    recipe_search(searchQuery text, numResults int)
returns table(
            recipeId int,
            recipe_name text,
            nutrition text,
            score real)
as $$
declare
    query_embedding vector(1536);
begin
    query_embedding := (azure_openai.create_embeddings('text-embedding-ada-002', searchQuery));
    return query
    select
        r.rid,
        r.recipe_name,
        r.nutrition,
        (r.embedding <=> query_embedding)::real as score
    from
        recipes r
    order by score asc limit numResults; -- cosine distance
end $$
language plpgsql;
```

Now just invoke the function to search:

```sql
select recipeid, recipe_name, score from recipe_search('vegan recipes', 10);
```

And explore the results:

```bash
 recipeid |                         recipe_name                          |   score
----------+--------------------------------------------------------------+------------
