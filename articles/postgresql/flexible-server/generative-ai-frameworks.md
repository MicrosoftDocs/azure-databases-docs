# Azure Database for PostgreSQL integrations for AI applications

Azure Database for PostgreSQL seamlessly integrates with leading large language model (LLM) orchestration packages so that developers can use advanced AI capabilities within their applications. These orchestration packages can streamline the management and use of LLMs, embedding models, and databases in developing generative AI applications.

## List of LLM orchestration packages

| Integration tool | Description | Azure Database for PostgreSQL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel) | An open-source framework by Microsoft that combines AI agents with languages like C#, Python, and Java. It enables seamless orchestration of code and AI models. | [Python connector](/semantic-kernel/concepts/vector-store-connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/postgres-connector?pivots=programming-language-python) <br> [.NET connector](/semantic-kernel/concepts/vector-store-connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/postgres-connector?pivots=programming-language-csharp) <br> [Java connector](/semantic-kernel/concepts/vector-store-connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/postgres-connector?pivots=programming-language-java) |
| [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) | A framework that simplifies the creation of applications powered by LLMs. It offers tools for context-aware reasoning applications in Python, JavaScript, and Java. | [Python](generative-ai-develop-with-langchain.md) <br> [JavaScript](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/pgvector/) |
| [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) | A framework for building context-augmented AI applications that can integrate private or domain-specific data with LLMs for complex workflows. | [Python](https://aka.ms/azpg-llamaindex) |
| [GraphRAG](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/) | A framework by Microsoft that uses Azure Database for PostgreSQL to create AI-powered knowledge graphs. It enables robust data models and reveals relationships in semistructured data. | [Quickstart](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/graphrag-legalcases-postgres/) |
