# Logs in Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-postgresql-flexible-server](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/postgresql/includes/applies-to-postgresql-flexible-server.md)]

Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server allows you to configure and access Postgres' standard logs. The logs can be used to identify, troubleshoot, and repair configuration errors and suboptimal performance. Logging information you can configure and access includes errors, query information, autovacuum records, connections, and checkpoints. (Access to transaction logs is not available).

Audit logging is made available through a Postgres extension, `pgaudit`. To learn more, visit the [auditing concepts](concepts-audit.md) article.

## Configure logging

You can configure Postgres standard logging on your server using the logging server parameters. To learn more about Postgres log parameters, visit the [When To Log](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-logging.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-LOGGING-WHEN) and [What To Log](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-logging.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-LOGGING-WHAT) sections of the Postgres documentation. Most, but not all, Postgres logging parameters are available to configure in Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server.

To learn how to configure parameters in Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server, see the [portal documentation](how-to-configure-server-parameters.md) or the [CLI documentation](how-to-configure-server-parameters.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Configuring a high volume of logs, for example statement logging, can add significant performance overhead. 

## Accessing logs

Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server is integrated with Azure Monitor diagnostic settings. Diagnostic settings allows you to send your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server logs in JSON format to Azure Monitor Logs for analytics and alerting, Event Hubs for streaming, and Azure Storage for archiving. 

## Data Retention Policy and Pricing

For logs sent to Event Hubs or a Storage account, you can set up a retention policy to automatically delete data after a certain period. When it comes to logs sent to Log Analytics, the costs for Azure Monitor Log Analytics are primarily influenced by two factors:

- **Data Ingestion:** Charges are based on the volume of data that is ingested into the workspace.
- **Data Retention:** Logs stored in your Log Analytics workspace are kept free of charge for the first 31 days. Beyond this free retention period, there is a fee for storing data, calculated on a daily pro-rata basis, based on the amount of data (in GB) retained each month.

For a comprehensive breakdown of the costs associated with data ingestion and retention, please visit the [Azure Monitor pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/).
