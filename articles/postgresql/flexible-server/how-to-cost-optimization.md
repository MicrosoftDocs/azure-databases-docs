## 1. Use reserved capacity pricing

Azure Postgres reserved capacity pricing allows committing to a specific capacity for **1-3** **years**, saving costs for customers using Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server. The cost savings compared to pay-as-you-go pricing can be significant, depending on the amount of capacity reserved and the length of the term. Customers can purchase reserved capacity in increments of vCores and storage. Reserved capacity can cover costs for Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instances in the same region, applied to the customer's Azure subscription. Reserved pricing for Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server offers cost savings up to 40% for 1 year and up to 60% for 3-year commitments, for customers who reserve capacity. For more details, see Pricing Calculator | Microsoft Azure. To learn more, see [What are Azure Reservations?](/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/save-compute-costs-reservations)

## 2. Scale compute up/down

Scaling up or down the resources of an Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance can help you optimize costs. Adjust the vCores and storage as needed to only pay for necessary resources. Scaling can be done through the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure REST API. Scaling compute resources up or down can be done at any time and requires server restart. It's good practice to monitor your database usage patterns and adjust the resources accordingly to optimize costs and ensure performance. For more details, see Compute and Storage options in Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server.

Configure Non-prod environments conservatively - Configure idle dev/test/stage environments to have cost-efficient SKUs. Choosing Burstable SKUs is ideal for workloads that don't need continuous full capacity.

## 3. Using Azure advisor recommendations

Azure Advisor is a free service that provides recommendations to help optimize your Azure resources. It analyzes your resource configuration and usage patterns and provides recommendations on how to improve the performance, security, high availability, and cost-effectiveness of your Azure resources. The recommendations cover various Azure services including compute, storage, networking, and databases.

For Azure Database for PostgreSQL, Azure Advisor can provide recommendations on how to improve the performance, availability, and cost-effectiveness of your database. For example, it can suggest scaling the database up or down, using read-replicas to offload read-intensive workloads, or switching to reserved capacity pricing to reduce costs. Azure Advisor can also recommend security best practices, such as enabling encryption at rest, or enabling network security rules to limit incoming traffic to the database.

You can access the recommendations provided by Azure Advisor through the Azure portal, where you can view and implement the recommendations with just a few clicks. Implementing Azure Advisor recommendations can help you optimize your Azure resources and reduce costs.

## 4. Evaluate HA (high availability) and DR (disaster recovery) requirements

Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server has **built-in** node and storage resiliency at no extra cost to you. Node resiliency allows your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance to automatically failover to a healthy VM with no data loss (that is, RPO zero) and with no connection string changes except that your application must reconnect. Similarly, the data and transaction logs are stored in three synchronous copies, and it automatically detects storage corruption and takes the corrective action. For most Dev/Test workloads, and for many production workloads, this configuration should suffice. 

If your workload requires AZ resiliency and lower RTO, you can enable High Availability (HA) with in-zone or cross-AZ standby. This doubles your deployment costs, but it also provides a higher SLA. To achieve geo-resiliency for your application, you can set up GeoBackup for a lower cost but with a higher RTO. Alternatively, you can set up GeoReadReplica for double the cost, which offers an RTO in minutes if there was a geo-disaster.

Key take away is to evaluate the requirement of your full application stack and then choose the right configuration for the Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance. For example, if your application isn't AZ resilient, there's nothing to be gained by configuring Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server in AZ resilient configuration.

## 5. Consolidate databases and servers

Consolidating databases can be a cost-saving strategy for Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server. Consolidating multiple databases into a single Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance can reduce the number of instances and overall cost of running Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server. Follow these steps to consolidate your databases and save costs:

1. Access your server: Identify the server that can be consolidated, considering database's size, geo-region, configuration (CPU, memory, IOPS), performance requirements, workload type and data consistency needs.
1. Create a new Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance: Create a new Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance with enough vCPUs, memory, and storage to support the consolidated databases.
1. Reuse an existing Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance: In case you already have an existing server, make sure it has enough vCPUs, memory, and storage to support the consolidated databases.
1. Migrate the databases: Migrate the databases to the new Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance. You can use tools such as pg_dump and pg_restore to export and import databases.
1. Monitor performance: Monitor the performance of the consolidated Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance and adjust the resources as needed to ensure optimal performance.

Consolidating databases can help you save costs by reducing the number of Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instances you need to run and by enabling you to use larger instances that are more cost-effective than smaller instances. It is important to evaluate the impact of consolidation on your databases' performance and ensure that the consolidated Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance is appropriately sized to meet all database needs.
