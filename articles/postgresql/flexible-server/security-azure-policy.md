# Azure Policy Support for Azure Database for PostgreSQL

[Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/overview) helps you enforce organizational standards and assess compliance at scale. Through its compliance dashboard, it provides an aggregated view to evaluate the overall state of the environment, with the ability to drill down to the per-resource, per-policy granularity. It also helps bring your resources to compliance through bulk remediation for existing resources and automatic remediation for new resources.

## Built-in Policy Definitions

Microsoft develops and tests built-in policies to ensure they meet common standards and best practices. You can deploy them quickly without needing extra configuration, making them ideal for standard compliance requirements. Built-in policies often cover widely recognized standards and compliance frameworks.

The following section provides an index of Azure Policy built-in policy definitions for Azure Database for PostgreSQL. Use the link in the **Source** column to view the source on the Azure Policy GitHub repo.

| [Enforce SSL connection should be enabled for PostgreSQL flexible server instances](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fc29c38cb-74a7-4505-9a06-e588ab86620a) | Azure Database for PostgreSQL supports connecting your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance to client applications using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Enforcing SSL connections between your database instance and your client applications helps protect against attacks by encrypting the data stream between the server and your application. This configuration enforces that SSL is always enabled for accessing your PostgreSQL flexible server instance | AuditIfNotExists, Disabled | [1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/PostgreSQL/FlexibleServers_EnableSSL_AINE.json) |
| [Geo-redundant backup should be enabled for Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instances](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fcee2f9fd-3968-44be-a863-bd62c9884423) | Azure Database for PostgreSQL allows you to choose the redundancy option for your database server. It can be set to a geo-redundant backup storage in which the data isn't only stored within the region in which your server is hosted, but is also replicated to a paired region to provide recovery option for a region failure. Configuring geo-redundant storage for backup is only allowed during server create | Audit, Disabled | [1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/PostgreSQL/FlexibleServers_GeoRedundant_Audit.json) |

By default, the data is encrypted at rest with service-managed keys, but customer-managed keys are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance standards. Customer-managed keys enable the data to be encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key created and owned by you. You have full control and responsibility for the key lifecycle, including rotation and management | Audit, Deny, Disabled | [1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/PostgreSQL/FlexibleServers_EnableCMK_AINE.json) |
