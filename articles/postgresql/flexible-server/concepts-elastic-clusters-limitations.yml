summary: |
  [!INCLUDE [applies-to-postgresql-flexible-server](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/postgresql/includes/applies-to-postgresql-flexible-server.md)]

  The following section describes capacity and functional limits in elastic clusters with Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

  Current [limitation of Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible](concepts-limits.md) server also apply to elastic clusters.
  The rest of the document describes differences that apply only to elastic clusters.

sections:
  - name: General
    questions:
      - question: In what regions can I use elastic clusters?
        answer: |
          Elastic clusters are an Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server feature and as such are available in the [same regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/).

      - question: Can I create more databases in an elastic cluster?
        answer: |
          The Azure portal provides credentials to connect to exactly one database per cluster. Currently, creating another database isn't allowed, and the `CREATE DATABASE` command fails with an error.
          This database is called `postgres` by default. After the public preview, custom database names at cluster provisioning time will be supported.

      - question: What PostgreSQL version is supported with elastic clusters?
        answer: Elastic clusters support PostgreSQL version 16 during the public preview.

      - question: Can I use Major Version Upgrades with elastic clusters?
        answer: Currently, Major Version Upgrades aren't supported during the preview.

      - question: Can I download server logs?
        answer: Currently, downloading server logs isn't supported during the preview. You can use Azure Metrics, Log Analytic Workspaces and PostgreSQL views to analyze cluster behavior.

      - question: Can I use Terraform to deploy elastic clusters?
        answer: Currently, Terraform isn't supported during the preview. ARM templates are supported.

  - name: Backups
    questions:
      - question: Can I use GEO backups & GEO restore?
        answer: Currently, GEO backups & GEO restore aren't supported during the preview.

      - question: Is Long Term Retention (LTR) supported?
        answer: Currently, Long Term Retention isn't supported during the preview.

  - name: Extensions
    questions:
      - question: Which extensions are available for elastic clusters?
        answer: Elastic clusters are compatible with the majority of PostgreSQL extensions.  For a comprehensive list, please refer to the [extension compatibility matrix](https://github.com/citusdata/citus/blob/main/EXTENSION_COMPATIBILITY.md) in the Citus GitHub repository.  Be sure to review the release notes and support details when using any of the available extensions alongside elastic clusters.

      - question: Why isn't TimescaleDB available with elastic clusters?
        answer: Elastic clusters make use of key low-level system hooks which conflict with the TimescaleDB extension.  Fortunately, elastic clusters provide similar time-series capabilities.  You can learn more about timeseries data in the [Citus documentation](https://docs.citusdata.com/en/stable/use_cases/timeseries.html).

  - name: Migrations
    questions:
      - question: How can I migrate to/from elastic clusters?
        answer: Migrations to/from elastic clusters can be done with pg_dump, pg_restore, and pgcopydb. Any other tool working with standard PostgreSQL should work.

      - question: Can I convert my existing Public Preview instance to General Availability (GA) elastic clusters?
        answer: If you have created any elastic clusters during the Public Preview phase, you are required to re-create them once the feature becomes Generally Available.  If this raises concerns, or if you need help determining whether your server meets the necessary requirements, please contact us at [pgfscitus@microsoft.com](mailto:pgfscitus@microsoft.com).

  - name: Networking
    questions:
      - question: Can I use PgBouncer for connection pooling with elastic clusters?
        answer: Yes, PgBouncer is supported with elastic clusters. Port 6432 should be used for schema and node management operations, while port 8432 is load-balanced to PgBouncer instances running across all nodes in the cluster.
        
      - question: Can I use virtual network (VNet) injection with elastic clusters?
        answer: Currently, virtual network injection isn't supported during the preview.

      - question: Are Private Domain Name System (DNS) Zones supported with elastic clusters?
        answer: Currently, Private DNS Zones aren't supported during the preview.

  - name: Storage
    questions:
      - question: Can I use customer-managed keys (CMK) for storage encryption?
        answer: Customer-managed keys are not currently supported during the preview.

      - question: Is Storage Auto Scale available?
        answer: Currently, Storage Auto Scale isn't supported during the preview.

  - name: Authentication
    questions:
      - question: Can I use Microsoft Entra ID authentication with elastic clusters?
        answer: Microsoft Entra ID authentication is supported for elastic clusters.

  - name: Performance
    questions:
      - question: Can I use Query Performance Insights with elastic clusters?
        answer: Currently, Query Performance Insights isn't supported during the preview.

      - question: Can I use Automatic Index Tuning with elastic clusters?
        answer: Currently, Automatic Index Tuning isn't supported during the preview.

      - question: Can I use replicas with elastic clusters?
        answer: Elastic clusters currently support a single read-replica during the preview.
