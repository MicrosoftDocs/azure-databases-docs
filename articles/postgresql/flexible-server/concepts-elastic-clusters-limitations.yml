summary: |
  [!INCLUDE [applies-to-postgresql-flexible-server](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/postgresql/includes/applies-to-postgresql-flexible-server.md)]

  The following section describes capacity and functional limits in elastic clusters with Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

  Current [limitation of Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible](concepts-limits.md) server also apply to elastic clusters.
  The rest of the document describes differences that apply only to elastic clusters.

sections:
  - name: General
    questions:
      - question: In what regions can I use elastic clusters?
        answer: |
          Elastic clusters are a feature of Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instances and as such are available in the [same regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/).
          
      - question: Can I create more databases in an elastic cluster?
        answer: |
          The Azure portal provides credentials to connect to exactly one database per cluster. Currently, creating another database isn't allowed, and the `CREATE DATABASE` command fails with an error.
          This database is called `postgres` by default. After the public preview, custom database names at cluster provisioning time will be supported.

      - question: What PostgreSQL version is supported with elastic clusters?
        answer: Elastic clusters support PostgreSQL version 16 during the public preview.

      - question: Can I use Major Version Upgrades with elastic clusters?
        answer: Currently, Major Version Upgrades aren't supported during the preview.

      - question: Can I download server logs?
        answer: Currently, downloading server logs isn't supported during the preview. You can use Azure Metrics, Log Analytic Workspaces and PostgreSQL views to analyze cluster behavior.

      - question: Can I use Terraform to deploy elastic clusters?
        answer: Terraform isn't available during the preview period.

  - name: Backups
    questions:
      - question: Can I use GEO backups & GEO restore?
        answer: Currently, GEO backups & GEO restore aren't supported during the preview.

      - question: Is Long Term Retention (LTR) supported?
        answer: Currently, Long Term Retention isn't supported during the preview.

  - name: Extensions
    questions:
      - question: Which extensions are available for elastic clusters?
        answer: Elastic clusters are compatible with the majority of PostgreSQL extensions.  For a comprehensive list, please refer to the [extension compatibility matrix](https://github.com/citusdata/citus/blob/main/EXTENSION_COMPATIBILITY.md) in the Citus GitHub repository.  Be sure to review the release notes and support details when using any of the available extensions alongside elastic clusters.

      - question: Why isn't TimescaleDB available with elastic clusters?
        answer: Elastic clusters make use of key low-level system hooks which are incompatible with the TimescaleDB extension.

  - name: Migrations
    questions:
      - question: How can I migrate to/from elastic clusters?
        answer: Migrations to/from elastic clusters can be done with pg_dump, pg_restore, and pgcopydb. Any other tool working with standard PostgreSQL should work.

      - question: Can I convert my existing Public Preview instance to General Availability (GA) elastic clusters?
        answer: If you have created any elastic clusters during the Public Preview phase, you are required to re-create them once the feature becomes Generally Available.  If this raises concerns, or if you need help determining whether your server meets the necessary requirements, please contact us by going to the Azure portal, selecting your Azure Postgres resource, and following the instructions in the banner.

  - name: Networking
    questions:
      - question: Can I use PgBouncer for connection pooling with elastic clusters?
        answer: Yes, PgBouncer is supported with elastic clusters. Port 6432 should be used for schema and node management operations, while port 8432 is load-balanced to all PgBouncer instances running across your nodes in the cluster.

      - question: Can I use virtual network (VNet) injection with elastic clusters?
        answer: Virtual network injection is not currently supported for elastic clusters.  We recommend using Private Link Endpoints for any network isolation requirements.

      - question: Are Private Domain Name System (DNS) Zones supported with elastic clusters?
        answer: Currently, Private DNS Zones aren't supported during the preview.

  - name: Storage
    questions:
      - question: Can I use customer-managed keys (CMK) for storage encryption?
        answer: Customer-managed keys are not currently supported during the public preview.

      - question: Is Storage Auto Scale available?
        answer: Storage Auto Scale is not available, however you can manually scale cluster storage and I/O throughput as needed.

  - name: Authentication
    questions:
      - question: Can I use Microsoft Entra ID authentication with elastic clusters?
        answer: Microsoft Entra ID authentication is supported for elastic clusters.

  - name: Performance
    questions:
      - question: Can I use Query Performance Insights with elastic clusters?
        answer: Query Performance Insights is not currently supported.

      - question: Can I use Automatic Index Tuning with elastic clusters?
        answer: Automatic Index Tuning is not currently supported.

      - question: Can I use replicas with elastic clusters?
        answer: Elastic clusters currently support the configuration of a single read-replica.  Elastic clusters can also be configured for high availability (HA) with automatic failover.
