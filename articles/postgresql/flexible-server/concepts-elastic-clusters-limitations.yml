  [!INCLUDE [applies-to-postgresql-flexible-server](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/postgresql/includes/applies-to-postgresql-flexible-server.md)]

  The following section describes capacity and functional limits in elastic clusters with Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

  Current [limitation of Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible](concepts-limits.md) server also apply to elastic clusters.
  The rest of the document describes differences that apply only to elastic clusters.

sections:
  - name: General
    questions:
      - question: In what regions can I use elastic clusters?
        answer: |
          Elastic clusters are an Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server feature and as such are available in the [same regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/).
          
      - question: Elastic clusters aren't available in the region I need, what can I do?
        answer: |
          We're enabling other regions shortly, if you're interested in specific regions fill out [this form](https://aka.ms/preview-pg-citus).

      - question: Can I create more databases in an elastic cluster?
        answer: |
          The Azure portal provides credentials to connect to exactly one database per cluster. Currently, creating another database isn't allowed, and the `CREATE DATABASE` command fails with an error.

          This database is called `postgres` by default. After the public preview, custom database names at cluster provisioning time will be supported.
      - question: What PostgreSQL version is supported with elastic clusters?
        answer: Elastic clusters support PostgreSQL version 16 during the public preview.
      - question: Can I use Major Version Upgrades with elastic clusters?
        answer: Currently, Major Version Upgrades aren't supported during the preview.
      - question: Can I download server logs?
        answer: Currently, downloading server logs isn't supported during the preview. You can use Azure Metrics, Log Analytic Workspaces and PostgreSQL views to analyze cluster behavior.
      - question: Can I use terraform to deploy elastic clusters?
        answer: Currently, terraform isn't supported during the preview. ARM templates are supported.
  - name: Backups
    questions:
      - question: Can I use GEO backups & GEO restore?

        answer: Currently, Long Term Retention isn't supported during the preview.
  - name: Extensions
    questions:
      - question: Why is TimescaleDB not available with elastic clusters?
        answer: TimescaleDB extension isn't supported on elastic cluster due to low-level conflicts with the Citus extension.
      - question: What extensions aren't supported during preview?
        answer: |

            - anon
            - pg_qs - Query Store
            - postgis_topology
            - TimescaleDB

  - name: Migrations
    questions:
      - question: How can I migrate to/from elastic clusters?
        answer: Currently, migrations to/from elastic clusters can be done with pg_dump, pg_restore, and pgcopydb. Any other tool working with standard PostgreSQL should work.
  - name: Networking
    questions:
      - question: Can I use PgBouncer for connection pooling with elastic clusters?
