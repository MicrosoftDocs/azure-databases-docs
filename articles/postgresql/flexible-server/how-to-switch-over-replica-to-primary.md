# Switch over read replica to primary

This article provides step-by-step instructions to switch over a read replica of an Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server so that it becomes the new primary server of the replication set.

## Steps to switch over read replica to primary

### [Portal](#tab/portal-switch-over-read-replica-to-primary)

Using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/):

1. Select the Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server for which you want to show its associated virtual endpoints.

2. In the resource menu, under the **Settings** section, select **Replication**.

3. Select the **Promote** icon to the side of the name of the endpoint of the read replica to which you want to switch over.

4. If the server doesn't have the virtual endpoints created, or if the read replica which you're trying to switch over to primary isn't the reader virtual endpoint's target server, an attempt to switch over a read replica to primary fails. That's what the warning displayed in the dialog reminds you.

5. In **Replica server to promote**, select **Promote to primary server** for **Action**. And select **Planned** or **Forced** for **Data sync**, depending on what suits your needs best. if you decide to use the **Forced** option, you have to mark the **I understand that any data changes that have not been replicated from the primary server will be lost. The read replica lag time is the approximate period of data loss.** checkbox to acknowledge the potential data loss. Finally, select **Promote**.

6. A notification informs you that the read replica is being switched over to primary.

7. When the process completes, a notification informs you that the read replica successfully switched over to primary.

### [CLI](#tab/cli-switch-over-read-replica-to-primary)

You can switch over a read replica to become the new primary of your Azure PostgreSQL flexible server via the [`az postgres flexible-server replica promote`](/cli/azure/postgres/flexible-server/replica#az-postgres-flexible-server-replica-promote) command.

If you want to make sure that the read replica is first synchronized with all the changes existing on the primary server, before the switch over is initiated, then set `--promote-option` to `planned`:

```azurecli-interactive
az postgres flexible-server replica promote \
  --resource-group <resource_group> \
  --name <server> \
  --promote-mode SwitchOver \
  --promote-option Planned
```

If you prefer the switch over to complete faster, and can assume that the changes which are already committed on the primary server but not yet synchronized to the read replica will be lost, then set `--promote-option` to `forced`:

```azurecli-interactive
az postgres flexible-server replica promote \
  --resource-group <resource_group> \
  --name <server> \
  --promote-mode SwitchOver \
  --promote-option Forced
```
