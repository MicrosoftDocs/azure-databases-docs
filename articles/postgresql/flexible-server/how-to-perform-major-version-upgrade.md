# Major version upgrade

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-postgresql-flexible-server](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/postgresql/includes/applies-to-postgresql-flexible-server.md)]

This article provides step-by-step instructions to perform a major version upgrade of an Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance.

> [!NOTE]  
> The major version upgrade action is irreversible. Make sure that you perform a point in time restore (PITR) of the production server that you want to upgrade. Test the upgrade in that restored, nonproduction instance before you upgrade the production environment.

## Steps to upgrade to a higher major version

### [Portal](#tab/portal-major-version-upgrade)

Using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/):

1. Select the instance of Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server which you want to upgrade.

2. From the resource menu, select **Overview**.

3. The status of the server must be **Ready**, for the **Upgrade** button to be enabled.

4. Select **Upgrade**.

5. The **Upgrade** pane provides some recommendations, and warns you about the consequences of initiating the upgrade.

11. Then, you can select the **Go to resource** button to validate your upgrade.

### [CLI](#tab/cli-major-version-upgrade)

You can upgrade the major version via the [az postgres flexible-server upgrade](/cli/azure/postgres/flexible-server#az-postgres-flexible-server-upgrade).

```azurecli-interactive
az postgres flexible-server upgrade --resource-group <resource_group> --name <server> --version <target_version>
```
