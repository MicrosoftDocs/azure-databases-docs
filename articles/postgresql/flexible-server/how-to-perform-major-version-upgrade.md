# Major version upgrade of Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-postgresql-flexible-server](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/postgresql/includes/applies-to-postgresql-flexible-server.md)]

This article provides a step-by-step procedure to perform a major version upgrade of an Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance.

> [!NOTE]  
> The major version upgrade action is irreversible. Please perform a Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR) of your production server and test the upgrade in the non-production environment.

## Upgrade to the major version of your choice

### [Portal](#tab/portal)

Using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/):

1. Select the instance of Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server which you want to upgrade.

2. From the resource menu, select **Overview**, and then select **Upgrade**.

3. Choose the major version to which you want to upgrade your instance, and click **Upgrade**.

4. During upgrade, users have to wait for the process to complete. You can resume accessing the server once the server is back online.

5. Once the upgrade completes successfully, you can expand **Deployment details**, and select **Operation details** to see more information about the upgrade process, like duration, provisioning state, etc. Then you can select the **Go to resource** button to validate your upgrade.

6. Notice that the name of the server remains unchanged and PostgreSQL version upgraded to desired target version, with the latest minor version.

### [CLI](#tab/cli)

You can upgrade the major version via the CLI upgrade [command](/cli/azure/postgres/flexible-server#az-postgres-flexible-server-upgrade).

```azurecli
az postgres flexible-server upgrade --resource-group <resource_group> --name <server> --version <target_version>
```
