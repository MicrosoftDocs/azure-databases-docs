# Create a read replica

This article provides step-by-step instructions to create a read replica of an Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance.

> [!NOTE]  
> When deploying read replicas for persistent heavy write-intensive primary workloads, the replication lag could continue to grow and might never catch up with the primary. It might also increase storage usage at the primary as the WAL files are only deleted once received at the replica.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Review the [considerations section in the overview article of read replicas](concepts-read-replicas.md#considerations).
>  
> Before changing the values of the following server parameters on the primary server, change them on the read replicas first. In doing so, you avoid issues during promotion of a read replica to primary: `max_connections`, `max_prepared_transactions`, `max_locks_per_transaction`, `max_wal_senders`, `max_worker_processes`.

Before setting up a read replica for your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance, ensure the primary server is configured to meet the necessary prerequisites. Specific settings on the primary server can affect the ability to create replicas.

**Storage autogrow**: Storage autogrow settings on the primary server and its read replicas must adhere to specific guidelines to ensure consistency and prevent replication disruptions. Refer to the [Storage autogrow](concepts-read-replicas.md#storage-autogrow) for detailed rules and settings.

**Storage type**: Read replicas can only be created on servers that are configured to use Premium SSD storage type. If your workload requires read replicas, make sure that the primary server is created with that storage type.

## Steps to create a read replica

### [Portal](#tab/portal-create-read-replica)

Using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/):

1. Select the Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance that you want to use as the primary server.

2. In the resource menu, under the **Settings** section, select **Replication**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-read-replicas/replication.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Replication page." lightbox="./media/how-to-read-replicas/replication.png":::

3.  In the **Servers** section, select **Create replica**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-read-replicas/create-replica.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the location of the Create replica button in the Replication page." lightbox="./media/how-to-read-replicas/create-replica.png":::

4. You're redirected to the **Add read replica to Azure Database for PostgreSQL** wizard, from where you can configure some settings for the new read replica that is created.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-read-replicas/add-read-replica-wizard.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Add read replica to Azure Database for PostgreSQL wizard." lightbox="./media/how-to-read-replicas/add-read-replica-wizard.png":::

5. Use the following table to understand the meaning of the different fields available in the **Basics** page, and as guidance to fill the page.

    | Section | Setting | Suggested value | Description | Can be changed after instance creation |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | **Project details** | | | | |
    | | **Subscription** | The name of the [subscription](/microsoft-365/enterprise/subscriptions-licenses-accounts-and-tenants-for-microsoft-cloud-offerings#subscriptions) in which you want to create the resource. | A subscription is an agreement with Microsoft to use one or more Microsoft cloud platforms or services, for which charges accrue based on either a per-user license fee or on cloud-based resource consumption. | An existing Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance can be moved to a different subscription from the one it was originally created. For more information, see Move [Azure resources to a new resource group or subscription](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/move-resource-group-and-subscription). |
    | | **Resource group** | The [resource group](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal#what-is-a-resource-group) in the selected subscription, in which you want to create the resource. It can be an existing resource group, or you can select **Create new**, and provide a name in that subscription which is unique among the existing resource group names. | A resource group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. The resource group can include all the resources for the solution, or only those resources that you want to manage as a group. You decide how you want to allocate resources to resource groups based on what makes the most sense for your organization. Generally, add resources that share the same lifecycle to the same resource group so you can easily deploy, update, and delete them as a group | An existing Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance can be moved to a different subscription from the one it was originally created. For more information, see Move [Azure resources to a new resource group or subscription](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/move-resource-group-and-subscription). |
    | **Server details** | | | | |
    | | **Primary server name** | The name of the primary server for which you're trying to create a read replica. | A unique name that identifies your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance. The domain name `postgres.database.azure.com` is appended to the server name you provide, to conform the fully qualified host name by which you can use a Domain Naming System server to resolve the IP address of your instance. | |
    | | **Server name** | The name that you want to assign to the new read replica. | A unique name that identifies your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance. The domain name `postgres.database.azure.com` is appended to the server name you provide, to conform the fully qualified host name by which you can use a Domain Naming System server to resolve the IP address of your instance. | Although the server name can't be changed after server creation, you can use the [point in time recovery](concepts-backup-restore.md#point-in-time-recovery) feature, to restore the server under a different name. An alternative approach to continue using the existing server, but being able to refer to it using a different server name, would use the [virtual endpoints](concepts-read-replicas-virtual-endpoints.md) to create a writer endpoint with the new desired name. With this approach, you could refer to the instance by its original name, or that assigned to the write virtual endpoint. |
    | | **Location** | The name of one of the [regions in which the service is supported](overview.md#azure-regions). Point in time restore only supports the deployment of the new server in the same region in which the source server exists. | Compliance, data residency, pricing, proximity to your users, or availability of other services in the same region, are some of the requirements you should use when choosing the region. | The service doesn't offer a feature to automatically and transparently relocate an instance to a different region. |
    | | **Compute + storage** | Assigns the same type and size of compute and same size of storage, as the ones used by the source server at the time the backup is restored. However, if you select the **Configure server** link, you can change the type of storage allocated to the new server, and whether or not it should be provisioned with geo-redundant backups. | | After the new server is deployed, its compute options can be scaled up or down. |
    | | **Availability zone** | Your preferred [availability zone](/azure/reliability/availability-zones-overview). | You can choose in which availability zone you want your server to be deployed. Being able to choose the availability zone in which your instance is deployed, is useful to colocate it with your application. If you choose *No preference*, a default availability zone is automatically assigned to your instance during its creation. | Although the availability zone in which an instance is deployed can't be changed after its creation, you can use the [point in time recovery](concepts-backup-restore.md#point-in-time-recovery) feature to restore the server under a different name on a different availability zone. |
    | | **Authentication** | These settings are informational only. All settings related to authentication used by the read replica are inherited from the primary server. | | Can be changed on the primary server and would the primary server and all existing read replicas. |

6. If you want to change the compute tier, processor or size automatically assigned to the new server, or if you want to change some of the storage settings of the read replica, select **Configure server**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-read-replicas/configure-server-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the location of the Configure server link." lightbox="./media/how-to-read-replicas/configure-server-button.png":::

7. The **Compute + storage** opens to show compute and storage options for the new server.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-read-replicas/configure-server-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Compute + storage page." lightbox="./media/how-to-read-replicas/configure-server-page.png":::

8. Use the following table to understand the meaning of the different fields available in the **Compute + storage** page, and as guidance to fill the page.

    | Section | Setting | Suggested value | Description | Can be changed after read replica creation |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | **Compute** | | | | |
    | | **Compute tier** | By default, it's automatically set to the same tier assigned to the primary server. However, you can set it to any other compute tier on which read replicas are supported. | Possible values are **General Purpose** (typically used for production environments with most common workloads), and **Memory Optimized** (typically used for production environments running workloads that require a high memory to CPU ratio). For more information, see [Compute options in Azure Database for PostgreSQL](concepts-compute.md). | Can be changed after the read replica is created. However, if you're using some functionality which is only supported on certain tiers and change the current tier to one in which the feature isn't supported, the feature stops being available or gets disabled. |
    | | **Compute size** | By default, it's automatically set to the same compute size assigned to the primary server. However, you can set it to any other compute size on, as long as it has the same or a higher number of vCores as the primary server. | Notice that the list of supported values might vary across regions, depending on the hardware available on each region. For more information, see [Compute options in Azure Database for PostgreSQL](concepts-compute.md). | Can be changed after read replica is created. |
    | **Storage** | | | | |
    | | **Storage type** | Leave it as is configured **Premium SSD**. | Setting the type of storage to a value different than that of the primary server isn't supported. The wizard automatically sets this property to match the type of storage assigned to the primary server. | Can't be changed after the read replica is created. |
    | | **Storage size** | By default, it's set to the same value as the storage size of the primary server. However, it can be set to any higher value. | | Can be changed after the read replica instance is created. It can only be increased. Manual or automatic shrinking of storage isn't supported. |
    | | **Performance tier** | By default, it's automatically set to the same value as the primary server. However, it can be changed to a different value. | Performance of Premium solid-state drives (SSD) is set when you create the disk, in the form of their performance tier. When setting the provisioned size of the disk, a performance tier is automatically selected. This performance tier determines the IOPS and throughput of your managed disk. For Premium SSD disks, this tier can be changed at deployment or afterwards, without changing the size of the disk, and without downtime. Changing the tier allows you to prepare for and meet higher demand without using your disk's bursting capability. It can be more cost-effective to change your performance tier rather than rely on bursting, depending on how long the extra performance is necessary. This is ideal for events that temporarily require a consistently higher level of performance. Events like holiday shopping, performance testing, or running a training environment. To handle these events, you can switch a disk to a higher performance tier without downtime, for as long as you need the extra performance. You can then return to the original tier without downtime when the extra performance is no longer necessary. | Can be changed after the instance is created. |
    | | **Storage autogrow** | Can't be changed and is automatically set to the same value as the source server. | Notice that this option might not be supported for some storage types, and it might not be honored for certain storage sizes. For more information, see [Configure storage autogrow](how-to-auto-grow-storage.md). | Can be changed after the instance is created, as long as the storage type supports this feature. |


5.  Continue to the **Networking**, **Security**, or **Tags** tabs, if you need to change any of the settings which are allowed to differ from the primary server. Once all the new replica is configured to your needs, select **Review + create**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-read-replicas/review-and-create.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the location of the Review + create button." lightbox="./media/how-to-read-replicas/review-and-create.png":::

7.  Review that all configurations for the new deployment are correctly set, and select **Create**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-read-replicas/create.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the location of the Create button." lightbox="./media/how-to-read-replicas/create.png":::

8.  A new deployment is launched to create your new Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance and make it a read replica of the primary server.
    
    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-read-replicas/create-replica-deployment-progress.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the deployment in progress to create your new Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance." lightbox="./media/how-to-read-replicas/create-replica-deployment-progress.png":::

9. When the deployment completes, you can select **Go to resource**, to start using your new Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-read-replicas/create-replica-deployment-completed.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the deployment successfully completed of your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance." lightbox="./media/how-to-read-replicas/create-replica-deployment-completed.png":::

10. It takes you to the **Overview** page of the replica server.

11. In the resource menu, under the **Settings** section, select **Replication**. Under **Servers**, find the list of servers that conform the replication set, and the role that each of them is taking.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-read-replicas/list-replicas-from-replica.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the list of servers that conform a replication set." lightbox="./media/how-to-read-replicas/list-replicas-from-replica.png":::

### [CLI](#tab/cli-create-read-replica)

You can create a read replica for your Azure PostgreSQL flexible server instance via the [`az postgres flexible-server replica create`](/cli/azure/postgres/flexible-server/replica#az-postgres-flexible-server-replica-create) command. 

```azurecli-interactive
az postgres flexible-server replica create \
  --replica-name <replica_name> \
  --resource-group <resource_group> \
  --source-server <source_server> \
  --location <location>
```
---
<!--
#### [REST API](#tab/restapi)

Initiate an `HTTP PUT` request by using the [servers create API](/rest/api/postgresql/servers/create):

```http
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.DBForPostgreSql/flexibleServers/{replicaserverName}?api-version=2022-12-01
```

Here, you need to replace `{subscriptionId}`, `{resourceGroupName}`, and `{replicaserverName}` with your specific Azure subscription ID, the name of your resource group, and the desired name for your read replica, respectively.

```json
{
  "location": "eastus",
  "properties": {
    "createMode": "Replica",
    "SourceServerResourceId": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.DBForPostgreSql/flexibleServers/{sourceserverName}"
  }
}
```

After the read replica is created, the properties of all servers, which are replicas of a primary replica can be obtained by initiating an `HTTP GET` request by using [replicas list by server API](/rest/api/postgresql/replicas/list-by-server): 

```http
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.DBForPostgreSql/flexibleServers/{sourceserverName}/replicas?api-version=2022-12-01
```

Here, you need to replace `{subscriptionId}`, `{resourceGroupName}`, and `{sourceserverName}` with your specific Azure subscription ID, the name of your resource group, and the name you assigned to your primary replica, respectively.

- Set the replica server name.

   > [!TIP]  
   > It is a Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) best practice to [use a resource naming convention](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-naming) that will allow you to easily determine what instance you are connecting to or managing and where it resides.

- Select a location different from your primary but note that you can select the same region.

   > [!TIP]  
   > To learn more about which regions you can create a replica in, visit the [read replica concepts article](concepts-read-replicas.md).

- Set the compute and storage to what you recorded from your primary. If the displayed compute doesn't match, select **Configure server** and select the appropriate one.

   > [!NOTE]  
   > If you select a compute size smaller than the primary, the deployment will fail. Also be aware that the compute size might not be available in a different region.
