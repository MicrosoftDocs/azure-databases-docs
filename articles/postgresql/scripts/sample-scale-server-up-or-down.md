# Monitor and scale a single Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server instance using Azure CLI

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-postgresql-flexible-server](../includes/applies-to-postgresql-flexible-server.md)]

This sample CLI script scales compute and storage for a single Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance after querying the metrics. Compute can scale up or down. Storage can only scale up. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Storage can only be scaled up, not down.
