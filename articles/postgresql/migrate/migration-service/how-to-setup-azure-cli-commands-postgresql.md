# How to set up Azure CLI for migration service in Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server

The Azure CLI is a set of commands used across Azure services to create and manage resources. It provides the same capabilities as the Azure portal but is optimized for users who prefer to work within a command-line environment. To begin migrating using Azure CLI, you need to install the Azure CLI on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

- **Install Azure CLI**: Depending on your operating system, download and install the Azure CLI. It's available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

- **Azure CLI Installation Guide**: Follow the instructions provided in the official Azure documentation to install the Azure CLI - [How to install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

- **Check Azure CLI Version**: Ensure that your Azure CLI version is at least 2.56.0 or higher, as this is required for the migration service. Use the command `az --version` to check your current version.

- **Sign in to Azure**: After installation, execute `az login` to authenticate. This opens your default browser to complete the sign-in process with your Azure credentials.

These steps prepare your environment for using the Azure CLI to manage the migration service in Azure Database for PostgreSQL effectively. Always refer to the latest Azure documentation for any updates or changes to the installation process.

## Set up CLI commands for the migration service

All the CLI commands start with `az postgres flexible-server migration`. There are also help statements provided to assist you in understanding the various options and framing the correct syntax for the CLI commands.

Once the CLI is installed, open the command prompt and log into the Azure account using the following command.

```azurecli-interactive
az login
```

## Migrate commands

The migration service provides the following commands to help you migrate your PostgreSQL instances to Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server.

### Help command

The `--help` command in Azure CLI is a valuable option that provides detailed documentation about the commands and their subcommands, including the required verbs for operations. The `–-help`command displays the necessary commands and their associated actions for migration service in Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

```azurecli-interactive
az postgres flexible-server migration –-help
```

The output guides you through the necessary steps and parameters required to manage your database migrations effectively using the Azure CLI.

### Create command

The `az postgres flexible-server migration create` command in Azure CLI is used to initiate a new migration workflow. It facilitates the migration of databases from a source PostgreSQL instance to a target Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server instance. This command sets up the necessary parameters and configurations to ensure a smooth and efficient migration process.

For more information, see [az postgres flexible-server migration create](/cli/azure/postgres/flexible-server/migration#az-postgres-flexible-server-migration-create)

### List command

The `az postgres flexible-server migration list` command is used to list all the migration attempts made to an Azure Database for PostgreSQL target. This command provides an overview of the migrations that were initiated, allowing you to track the status and details of each migration attempt.

For more information, see [az postgres flexible-server migration list](/cli/azure/postgres/flexible-server/migration#az-postgres-flexible-server-migration-list)

### Show command

The `az postgres flexible-server migration show` command helps you monitor ongoing migrations and gives the current state and substate of the migration. These details include information on the current state and substate of the migration.

For more information, see [az postgres flexible-server migration show](/cli/azure/postgres/flexible-server/migration#az-postgres-flexible-server-migration-show)

Some possible migration states:

#### Migration states

| State | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **InProgress** | The migration infrastructure setup is underway, or the actual data migration is in progress. |
| **Canceled** | The migration is canceled or deleted. |
| **Failed** | The migration failed. |
| **Validation Failed** | The validation failed. |
| **Succeeded** | The migration succeeded and is complete. |
| **WaitingForUserAction** | Applicable only for online migration. Waiting for user action to perform cutover. |

#### Migration substates

| Substate | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **PerformingPreRequisiteSteps** | Infrastructure setup is underway for data migration. |
| **Validation in Progress** | Validation is in progress. |
| **MigratingData** | Data migration is in progress. |
| **CompletingMigration** | Migration is in the final stages of completion. |
| **Completed** | Migration is complete. |
| **Failed** | Migration failed. |

#### Validation substates

| Substate | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Failed** | Validation failed. |
| **Succeeded** | Validation is successful. |
| **Warning** | Validation is in warning. |

### Update command

The `az postgres flexible-server migration update` command is used to manage the migration process to an Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server. Specifically, it can be used to:

- **Perform a cutover**: This finalizes the migration process by switching the database traffic from the source server to the target Flexible Server.

  - After the base data migration is complete, the migration task moves to the `WaitingForCutoverTrigger` substate. In this state, users can trigger the cutover from the portal by selecting the migration name in the migration grid or through the CLI.
  - Before initiating cutover, it's important to ensure that:
    - Writes to the source are stopped
    - `latency` value decreases to 0 or close to 0
    - `latency` value indicates when the target last synced with the source. At this point, writes to the source can be stopped and cutover initiated. In case there's heavy traffic at the source, you should stop writes first so that `Latency` can come close to 0, and then a cutover is initiated.
    - The Cutover operation applies all pending changes from the Source to the Target and completes the migration. If you trigger a "Cutover" even with nonzero `Latency`, the replication stops until that point in time. All the data on source until the cutover point is then applied on the target. Say a latency was 15 minutes at the cutover point, so all the changed data in the last 15 minutes applies to the target.

- **Cancel the migration**: If needed, this option allows you to stop the migration process.

- **Setup logical replication at the source**: This is useful when the source server is an Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Single Server, as it prepares the server for data replication to the Flexible Server.

For more information, see [az postgres flexible-server migration update](/cli/azure/postgres/flexible-server/migration#az-postgres-flexible-server-migration-update)

## Summary

The following table summarizes the parameters used by the migration commands:
