> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The azure_local_ai extension for PostgreSQL is [retired](/lifecycle/definitions#retirement). After this date, the extension will no longer be supported or maintained. To ensure a smooth transition, we encourage all users to explore the azure_ai extension and remote embedding calls with models deployed in Azure OpenAI or Azure Machine Learning. For more information, visit the [Azure AI extension](../azure-ai/generative-ai-azure-overview.md).
