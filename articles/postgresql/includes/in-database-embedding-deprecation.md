> The azure_local_ai extension for PostgreSQL is [retiring on March 21, 2025](/lifecycle/definitions#retirement). After this date, the extension will no longer be supported or maintained. To ensure a smooth transition, we encourage all users to explore the azure_ai extension and remote embedding calls with models deployed in Azure OpenAI or Azure ML. For more information, visit the [Azure AI extension](../flexible-server/generative-ai-azure-overview.md).
