# Security in Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL

[!INCLUDE [Note - Recommended services](includes/note-recommended-services.md)]

This page outlines the multiple layers of security available to protect the data in your cluster. 

## Information protection and encryption

### In transit

Whenever data is ingested into a node, Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL secures your data by encrypting it in-transit with Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 or higher. Encryption (SSL/TLS) is always enforced, and can’t be disabled.

The minimum TLS version required to connect to the cluster might be enforced by setting **ssl_min_protocol_version** coordinator and worker node parameter to *TLSV1.2* or *TLSV1.3* for TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3 respectively.  

### At rest

The Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL service uses the FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic module for storage encryption of data at-rest. Data, including backups, are encrypted on disk, including the temporary files created while running queries.
The service uses the AES 256-bit cipher included in Azure storage encryption, and the keys are system-managed. Storage encryption is always on, and can't be disabled.
