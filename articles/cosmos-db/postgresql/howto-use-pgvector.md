# How to enable and use `pgvector` on Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL

[!INCLUDE [Note - Recommended services](includes/note-recommended-services.md)]

## Enable extension

PostgreSQL extensions must be enabled in your database before you can use them. To enable the extension, run the command from the psql tool to load the packaged objects into your database.

```postgresql
SELECT CREATE_EXTENSION('vector');
```

> [!Note]
> To disable an extension use `drop_extension()`
