# Scheduled maintenance in Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL

[!INCLUDE [Note - Recommended services](includes/note-recommended-services.md)]

Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL does periodic maintenance to
keep your managed database secure, stable, and up-to-date.  During maintenance,
all nodes in the cluster get new features, updates, and patches.

The key features of scheduled maintenance for Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL are:

* Updates are applied at the same time on all nodes in the cluster
* Notifications about upcoming maintenance are posted to Azure Service Health
  five days in advance
* Usually there are at least 30 days between successful maintenance events for
  a cluster
* Preferred day of the week and time window within that day for maintenance
  start can be defined for each cluster individually

## Selecting a maintenance window and notification about upcoming maintenance

You can schedule maintenance during a specific day of the week and a time
window within that day. Or you can let the system pick a day and a time window
for you automatically. Either way, the system will alert you five days before
running any maintenance. The system will also let you know when maintenance is
started, and when it's successfully completed.

Notifications about upcoming scheduled maintenance are posted to Azure Service
Health and can be:

* Emailed to a specific address
* Emailed to an Azure Resource Manager Role
* Sent in a text message (SMS) to mobile devices
* Pushed as a notification to an Azure app
* Delivered as a voice message

When specifying preferences for the maintenance schedule, you can pick a day of
the week and a time window. If you don't specify, the system will pick times
between 11pm and 7am in your cluster's region time. You can define
different schedules for each cluster in your Azure
subscription.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Normally there are at least 30 days between successful scheduled maintenance
> events for a cluster.
>
> However, in case of a critical emergency update such as a severe
> vulnerability, the notification window could be shorter than five days. The
> critical update may be applied to your server even if a successful scheduled
> maintenance was performed in the last 30 days.

You can update scheduling settings at any time. If there's maintenance
scheduled for your cluster and you update the schedule,
the pre-existing events will be rescheduled.

If maintenance fails or gets canceled, the system will create a notification.
It will try maintenance again according to current scheduling settings, and
notify you five days before the next maintenance event.
