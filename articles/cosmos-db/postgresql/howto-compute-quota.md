# Change compute quotas in Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL

[!INCLUDE [Note - Recommended services](includes/note-recommended-services.md)]

Azure enforces a vCore quota per subscription per region. There are two
independently adjustable limits: vCores for coordinator nodes, and vCores for
worker nodes.

## Request quota increase

1. Select **New Support Request** in the Azure portal menu for your
   cluster.
2. Fill out **Summary** with the quota increase request for your region, for
   example *Quota increase in West Europe region.*
3. These fields should be autoselected, but verify:
   - **Issue Type** should be **Technical**.
   - **Service type** should be **Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL**.
4. For **Problem type**, select **Create, Update, and Drop Resources**.
5. For **Problem subtype**, select **Scaling Compute**.
6. Select **Next** to view recommended solutions, and then select **Return to support request**.
7. Select **Next** again. Under **Problem details**, provide the following information:
   - For **When did the problem start**, the date, time, and timezone when the problem started, or select **Not sure, use current time**.
   - For **Description**, quota increase details, for example *Need to increase worker node quota in West Europe to 512 vCores*.
