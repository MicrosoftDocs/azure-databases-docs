# How to ingest data by using Azure Stream Analytics in Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL

[!INCLUDE [PostgreSQL](../includes/appliesto-postgresql.md)]

[Azure Stream Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/stream-analytics/#features)
is a real-time analytics and event-processing engine that is designed to
process high volumes of fast streaming data from devices, sensors, and web
sites. It's also available on the Azure IoT Edge runtime, enabling data
processing on IoT devices.

Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL shines at real-time workloads such as
[IoT](quickstart-build-scalable-apps-model-high-throughput.md). For these workloads,
Stream Analytics can act as a no-code, performant and scalable
alternative to pre-process and stream data from Azure Event Hubs, Azure IoT Hub, and Azure
Blob Storage into Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL.

## Steps to set up Stream Analytics

> [!NOTE]
>> This article uses [Azure IoT Hub](/azure/iot-hub/iot-concepts-and-iot-hub)
> as an example datasource, but the technique is applicable to any other source
> supported by Stream Analytics. Also, the following demonstration data comes from the
> [Azure IoT Device Telemetry Simulator](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Iot-Telemetry-Simulator). This
> article doesn't cover setting up the simulator.

1. In the Azure portal, expand the portal menu at upper left and select **Create a resource**.
1. Select **Analytics** > **Stream Analytics job** from the results list.
1. Fill out the **New Stream Analytics job** page with the following information:
   * **Subscription** - Select the Azure subscription that you want to use for this job.
   * **Resource group** - Select the same resource group as your IoT hub.
   * **Name** - Enter a name to identify your Stream Analytics job.
   * **Region** - Select the Azure region to host your Stream Analytics job. Use the geographic location that's closest to your users for better performance and to reduce the data transfer cost.
   * **Hosting environment** - Select **Cloud** to deploy to the Azure cloud, or **Edge** to deploy to an IoT Edge device.
   * **Streaming units** - Select the number of streaming units for the computing resources you need to execute the job.
1. Select **Review + create**, and then select **Create**. You should see a **Deployment in progress** notification at upper right.

1. Configure job input.

   :::image type="content" source="media/howto-ingestion/azure-stream-analytics-03-input.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows configuring job input in Stream Analytics." border="true":::

   1. Once the resource deployment is complete, navigate to your Stream Analytics
      job. Select **Inputs** > **Add stream input** > **IoT Hub**.

   1. Fill out the **IoT Hub** page with the following values:
      * **Input alias** - Enter a name to identify the job input.
      * **Subscription** - Select the Azure subscription that has your IoT Hub account.
      * **IoT Hub** â€“ Select the name of your IoT hub.
   1. Select **Save**.
   1. Once the input stream is added, you can also verify or download the dataset flowing in.
      The following code shows the data for an example event:

      ```json
      {
         "deviceId": "sim000001",
         "time": "2022-04-25T13:49:11.6892185Z",
         "counter": 1,
         "EventProcessedUtcTime": "2022-04-25T13:49:41.4791613Z",
         "PartitionId": 3,
         "EventEnqueuedUtcTime": "2022-04-25T13:49:12.1820000Z",
         "IoTHub": {
           "MessageId": null,
           "CorrelationId": "aaaa0000-bb11-2222-33cc-444444dddddd",
           "ConnectionDeviceId": "sim000001",
           "ConnectionDeviceGenerationId": "637842405470327268",
           "EnqueuedTime": "2022-04-25T13:49:11.7060000Z"
         }
      }
      ```

1. Configure job output.

   1. On the Stream Analytics job page, select **Outputs** > **Add** > **PostgreSQL database (preview)**.

      :::image type="content" source="media/howto-ingestion/azure-stream-analytics-output.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting PostgreSQL database output.":::

   1. Fill out the **Azure PostgreSQL** page with the following values:
      * **Output alias** - Enter a name to identify the job's output.
      * Select **Provide PostgreSQL database settings manually** and enter the **Server fully qualified domain name**, **Database**, **Table**, **Username**, and **Password**. From the example dataset, use the table *device_data*.
   1. Select **Save**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/howto-ingestion/azure-stream-analytics-04-output.png" alt-text="Configure job output in Azure Stream Analytics." border="true":::

1. Define the transformation query.

   :::image type="content" source="media/howto-ingestion/azure-stream-analytics-05-transformation-query.png" alt-text="Transformation query in Azure Stream Analytics." border="true":::

   1. On the Stream Analytics job page, select **Query** from the left menu.
   1. For this tutorial, you ingest only the alternate events from IoT Hub into Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL, to reduce the overall data size. Copy and paste the following query into the query pane:

      ```sql
      select
         counter,
         iothub.connectiondeviceid,
         iothub.correlationid,
         iothub.connectiondevicegenerationid,
         iothub.enqueuedtime
      from
         [src-iot-hub]
      where counter%2 = 0;
      ```

   1. Select **Save query**.

      > [!NOTE]
      > You use the query to not only sample the data, but also to extract the
      > desired attributes from the data stream. The custom query option with
      > Stream Analytics is helpful in pre-processing/transforming the data
      > before it gets ingested into the database.

1. Start the Stream Analytics job and verify output.

   1. Return to the job overview page and select **Start**.
   1. On the **Start job** page, select **Now** for the **Job output start time**, and then select **Start**.
   1. The job takes some time to start the first time, but once triggered it continues to run as the data arrives. After a few minutes, you can query the cluster to verify that the data loaded.

      ```output
      citus=> SELECT * FROM public.device_data LIMIT 10;

       counter | connectiondeviceid |            correlationid             | connectiondevicegenerationid |         enqueuedtime
