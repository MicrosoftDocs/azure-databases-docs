# PostgreSQL extensions in Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL

[!INCLUDE [PostgreSQL](../includes/appliesto-postgresql.md)]

PostgreSQL extend the functionality of your database by using extensions. Extensions allow for bundling multiple related SQL objects together in a single package that can be loaded or removed from your database with a single command. After being loaded in the database, extensions can function like built-in features. For more information on PostgreSQL extensions, see [Package related objects into an extension](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/extend-extensions.html).

## Use PostgreSQL extensions

PostgreSQL extensions must be installed in your database before you can use them. To install a particular extension, run the [CREATE EXTENSION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createextension.html) command from the psql tool to load the packaged objects into your database.

> [!NOTE]
> If `CREATE EXTENSION` fails with a permission denied error, try the
> `create_extension()` function instead. For instance:
>
> ```sql
> SELECT create_extension('postgis');
> ```
>
> To remove an extension installed this way, use `drop_extension()`.

Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL currently supports a subset of key extensions as listed here. Extensions other than the ones listed aren't supported. You can't create your own extension with Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL.

## Extensions supported by Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL

The following tables list the standard PostgreSQL extensions that are supported on Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL. This information is also available by running `SELECT * FROM pg_available_extensions;`.

The versions of each extension installed in a cluster sometimes differ based on the version of PostgreSQL (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, or 16). The tables list extension versions per database version.

## pg_stat_statements
The [pg\_stat\_statements extension](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html) is preloaded on every Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL cluster to provide you with a means of tracking execution statistics of SQL statements.

The setting `pg_stat_statements.track` controls what statements are counted by the extension. It defaults to `top`, which means that all statements issued directly by clients are tracked. The two other tracking levels are `none` and `all`.

There's a tradeoff between the query execution information pg_stat_statements provides and the effect on server performance as it logs each SQL statement. If you aren't actively using the pg_stat_statements extension, we recommend that you set `pg_stat_statements.track` to `none`. Some third-party monitoring services might rely on pg_stat_statements to deliver query performance insights, so confirm whether it's the case for you or not.

## dblink and postgres_fdw

You can use dblink and postgres\_fdw to connect from one PostgreSQL server to
another, or to another database in the same server.  The receiving server needs
to allow connections from the sending server through its firewall.  To use
these extensions to connect between Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL clusters with [public access](./concepts-firewall-rules.md), set **Allow Azure services and resources to access this cluster (or
server)** to ON.  You also need to turn this setting ON if you want to use the
extensions to loop back to the same server.  The **Allow Azure services and
resources to access this cluster** setting can be found in the Azure portal
page for the cluster under **Networking**.  Currently, outbound connections
from Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL aren't supported.

## orafce extension

utl_file functions are disabled in orafce extension.
