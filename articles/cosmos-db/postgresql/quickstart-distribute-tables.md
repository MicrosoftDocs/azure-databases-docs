# Create and distribute tables in Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL

[!INCLUDE [Note - Recommended services](includes/note-recommended-services.md)]

In this example, we'll use Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL distributed tables to store and
query events recorded from GitHub open source contributors.

## Prerequisites

To follow this quickstart, you'll first need to:

1. [Create a cluster](quickstart-create-portal.md) in the Azure portal.
2. [Connect to the cluster](quickstart-connect-psql.md) with psql to
   run SQL commands.

## Create tables

Once you've connected via psql, let's create our table. Copy and paste the
following commands into the psql terminal window, and hit enter to run:

```sql
CREATE TABLE github_users
(
	user_id bigint,
	url text,
	login text,
	avatar_url text,
	gravatar_id text,
	display_login text
);

CREATE TABLE github_events
(
	event_id bigint,
	event_type text,
	event_public boolean,
	repo_id bigint,
	payload jsonb,
	repo jsonb,
	user_id bigint,
	org jsonb,
	created_at timestamp
);

CREATE INDEX event_type_index ON github_events (event_type);
CREATE INDEX payload_index ON github_events USING GIN (payload jsonb_path_ops);
```

Notice the GIN index on `payload` in `github_events`. The index allows fast
querying in the JSONB column. Since Citus is a PostgreSQL extension, Azure
Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL supports advanced PostgreSQL features like the JSONB
datatype for storing semi-structured data.

## Distribute tables

`create_distributed_table()` is the magic function that Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL
provides to distribute tables and use resources across multiple machines.  The
function decomposes tables into shards, which can be spread across nodes for
increased storage and compute performance.

> [!NOTE]
>
> In real applications, when your workload fits in 64 vCores, 256GB RAM and 2TB
> storage, you can use a single-node cluster. In this case, distributing tables
> is optional. Later, you can distribute tables as needed using
> [create_distributed_table_concurrently](reference-functions.md#create_distributed_table_concurrently).

Let's distribute the tables:

```sql
SELECT create_distributed_table('github_users', 'user_id');
SELECT create_distributed_table('github_events', 'user_id');
```

[!INCLUDE [dist-alert](includes/dist-alert.md)]

## Load data into distributed tables

We're ready to fill the tables with sample data. For this quickstart, we'll use
a dataset previously captured from the GitHub API.

We're going to use the pg_azure_storage extension, to load the data directly from a public container in Azure Blob Storage. First we need to create the extension in our database:

```sql
SELECT * FROM create_extension('azure_storage');
``` 

Run the following commands to have the database fetch the example CSV files and load them into the
database tables.

```sql
-- download users and store in table

COPY github_users FROM 'https://pgquickstart.blob.core.windows.net/github/users.csv.gz';

-- download events and store in table

COPY github_events FROM 'https://pgquickstart.blob.core.windows.net/github/events.csv.gz';
```

Notice how the extension recognized that the URLs provided to the copy command are from Azure Blob Storage, the files we pointed were gzip compressed and that was also automatically handled for us.

We can review details of our distributed tables, including their sizes, with
the `citus_tables` view:

```sql
SELECT * FROM citus_tables;
```

```
  table_name   | citus_table_type | distribution_column | colocation_id | table_size | shard_count | table_owner | access_method 
---------------+------------------+---------------------+---------------+------------+-------------+-------------+---------------
 github_events | distributed      | user_id             |             1 | 388 MB     |          32 | citus       | heap
 github_users  | distributed      | user_id             |             1 | 39 MB      |          32 | citus       | heap
(2 rows)
```

## Next steps

Now we have distributed tables and loaded them with data. Next, let's try
running queries across the distributed tables.
