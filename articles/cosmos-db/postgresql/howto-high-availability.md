# Configure high availability in Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL

[!INCLUDE [Note - Recommended services](includes/note-recommended-services.md)]

Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL provides high availability
(HA) to avoid database downtime. With HA enabled, every node in a cluster
gets a standby. If the original node becomes unhealthy, its standby is
promoted to replace it.

Enabling HA is possible during cluster creation on **Scale** page. Once cluster is provisioned, set **Enable high availability (HA)** checkbox in the **High availability** tab for your cluster in the Azure portal.

Click the **Save** button to apply your selection. Enabling HA can take some
time as the cluster provisions standby nodes and streams data to them.

The **Overview** tab for the cluster lists all nodes along with a **High availability** column indicating whether HA is successfully enabled for each node and **Availability zone** column that shows actual availability zone for each primary cluster node.
