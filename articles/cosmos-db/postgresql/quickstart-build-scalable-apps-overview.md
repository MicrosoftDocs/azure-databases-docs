# Build scalable apps in Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL

[!INCLUDE [Note - Recommended services](includes/note-recommended-services.md)]

There are three steps involved in building scalable apps with Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL:

1. Classify your application workload. There are use-case where Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL
   shines: Multitenant SaaS, microservices, real-time operational analytics, and high
   throughput OLTP. Determine whether your app falls into one of these categories.
2. Based on the workload, use [schema-based sharding](concepts-sharding-models.md#schema-based-sharding) or identify the optimal shard key for the distributed
   tables. Classify your tables as reference, distributed, or local. 
3. When using [row-based sharding](concepts-sharding-models.md#row-based-sharding), update the database schema and application queries to make them go fast
   across nodes.

**Next steps**

Before you start building a new app, you must first review a little more about
the architecture of Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL.
