# Model high-throughput transactional apps in Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL

[!INCLUDE [Note - Recommended services](includes/note-recommended-services.md)]

## Common filter as shard key

To pick the shard key for a high-throughput transactional application, follow
these guidelines:

* Choose a column that is used for point lookups and is present in most
  create, read, update, and delete operations.
* Choose a column that is a natural dimension in the data, or a central piece
  of the application. For example:
  * In an IOT workload, `device_id` is a good distribution column.

The choice of a good shard key helps optimize network hops, while taking
advantage of memory and compute to achieve millisecond latency.

## Optimal data model for high-throughput apps

Below is an example of a sample data-model for an IoT app that captures
telemetry (time series data) from devices. There are two tables for capturing
telemetry: `devices` and `events`. There could be other tables, but they're not
covered in this example.

When building a high-throughput app, keep some optimization in mind.

* Distribute large tables on a common column that is central piece of the app,
  and the column that your app mostly queries. In the above example of an IOT
  app, `device_id` is that column, and it co-locates the events and devices
  tables.
* The rest of the small tables can be reference tables.
* As IOT apps have a time dimension, partition your distributed tables based on
  time. You can use native Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL time series capabilities to
  create and maintain partitions.
  * Partitioning helps efficiently filter data for queries with time filters.
  * Expiring old data is also fast, using the DROP vs DELETE command.
  * The events table in our example is partitioned by month.
* Use the JSONB datatype to store semi-structured data. Device telemetry
  data is typically not structured, every device has its own metrics.
  * In our example,  the events table has a `detail` column, which is JSONB.
* If your IoT app requires geospatial features, you can use the PostGIS
  extension, which Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL supports natively.

## Next steps

Now we've finished exploring data modeling for scalable apps. The next step is
connecting and querying the database with your programming language of choice.
