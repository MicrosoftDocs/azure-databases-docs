# Multi-tenant monitoring

[!INCLUDE [Note - Recommended services](includes/note-recommended-services.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Applicable to Citus 11.3 & newer versions

Tenant monitoring is a crucial aspect of managing a multi-tenant SaaS platform. The feature offers insights into CPU usage and the overall query volume, attributed to specific tenants. Tracking of statistics is done locally on nodes where tenant resides and are made accessible at both tenant and node level of granularity. The collected statistics allows in quick identification of noisy neighbors & helps in better optimizing the resource usage in your cluster.

## Conceptual model

Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL uses row-based sharding at core, which means that each distributed table contains a distributed column - denoted as tenant key. Tenant key enables splitting data across shards, where each shard contains one or more tenants. Shards themselves are distributed among the nodes in the cluster, enabling horizontal scaling of your database.

The CPU time is measured in seconds, consumed by tenant, across all available cores on a node in a cluster. Total CPU time available on cluster, can be estimated as: `number_of_vcores * citus.stat_tenants_period * number_of_nodes`.

## Node parameters

### citus.stat_tenants_log_level (text)
Controls which message levels are written to the server log. Valid values are `DEBUG5`, `DEBUG4`, `DEBUG3`, `DEBUG2`, `DEBUG1`, `DEBUG`, `LOG`, `INFO`, `NOTICE`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`. Default is `LOG`.

### citus.stat_tenants_limit (int)
Controls the number of tenants (top `N`) tracked within a single time window. Default is `100`.

### citus.stat_tenants_period (int)
Controls the time window (in seconds) to which tenant statistics are allocated. Default is `60` seconds.

### citus.stat_tenants_track (boolean)
Enables or disables the tracking of tenant statistics. Default is `None`. Modification to the node parameter requires a restart.

## Statistics views 

### pg_catalog.citus_stat_tenants

The `citus_stat_tenants` view tracks these statistics within time buckets. Once a period ends, its statistics are stored in the last period, providing you with ongoing and completed period insights. Metrics currently tracked within the view include read query count, overall query count & CPU cycle consumed at the node, colocation group & tenant granularity.

### pg_catalog.citus_stat_tenants_reset()
The function resets the collected metrics within citus_stat_tenants view.

## Operations tracked
[!INCLUDE [Introduction to `tenant tracking`](includes/tenant-monitoring.md)]

In a multi-tenant environment, each tenant typically has access to their own dataset, and as a result, queries are filtered based on tenant keys. Any query in such systems, which operates across tenants gets initiated by the system administrator and aren't traced back to individual tenants. For example, to generate a report that includes aggregated data from all tenants - cross-tenant query is needed which can't be attributed to a specific tenant.

```postgresql
CREATE TABLE organizations (id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);

SELECT create_distributed_table ('organizations', 'id');

INSERT INTO organizations (name) VALUES ('Teleflora'); -- tracked
INSERT INTO organizations (name) VALUES ('BloomThat'); -- tracked
INSERT INTO organizations (name) VALUES ('UrbanStems');-- tracked

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM organizations where id = 1; -- tracked
```
```text
 count 
-------
     1
(1 row)
```
```postgresql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM organizations where id IN (1,2); -- untracked
```
```text
 count
-------
     1
(1 row)
```
```postgresql
UPDATE organizations SET name = 'Bloomers' WHERE id = 2; -- tracked
```
```text
UPDATE 1
```
```postgresql
DELETE FROM organizations WHERE id = 3; -- tracked
```
```text
DELETE 1
```

```postgresql
SELECT tenant_attribute,
       read_count_in_this_period,
       query_count_in_this_period,
       cpu_usage_in_this_period
FROM citus_stat_tenants;
```
```text
 tenant_attribute | read_count_in_this_period | query_count_in_this_period | cpu_usage_in_this_period 
------------------+---------------------------+----------------------------+--------------------------
 1                |                         2 |                          3 |                        0
 2                |                         0 |                          2 |                        0
 3                |                         0 |                          2 |                        0
