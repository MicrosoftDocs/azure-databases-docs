# Cluster upgrades in Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL

[!INCLUDE [Note - Recommended services](includes/note-recommended-services.md)]

The Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL managed service can handle upgrades of both the
PostgreSQL server, and the Citus extension. All clusters are created with [the latest Citus version](./reference-extensions.md#citus-extension) available for the major PostgreSQL version you select during cluster provisioning. When you select a PostgreSQL version such as PostgreSQL 15 for in-place cluster upgrade, the latest Citus version supported for selected PostgreSQL version is going to be installed. 

If you need to upgrade the Citus version only, you can do so by using an in-place upgrade. For instance, you might want to upgrade Citus 11.0 to Citus 11.3 on your PostgreSQL 14 cluster without upgrading Postgres version. 

## Upgrade precautions

Upgrades require some downtime in the database cluster. The exact time depends
on the source and destination versions of the upgrade. To prepare for the
production cluster upgrade, we recommend [testing the
upgrade](howto-upgrade.md#test-the-upgrade-first), and measure downtime during
the test.

Also, upgrading a major version of Citus can introduce changes in behavior.
It's best to familiarize yourself with new product features and changes to
avoid surprises.

Noteworthy Citus 12 changes:
* The default rebalance strategy changed from `by_shard_count` to `by_disk_size`.
* Support for PostgreSQL 13 has been dropped as of this version.

Noteworthy Citus 11 changes:

* Table shards might disappear in your SQL client. You can control their visibility
  using
  [citus.show_shards_for_app_name_prefixes](reference-parameters.md#citusshow_shards_for_app_name_prefixes-text).
* There are several [deprecated
  features](https://www.citusdata.com/updates/v11-0/#deprecated-features).
