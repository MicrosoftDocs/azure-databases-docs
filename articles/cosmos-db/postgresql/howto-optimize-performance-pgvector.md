# How to optimize performance when using pgvector on Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL

[!INCLUDE [Note - Recommended services](includes/note-recommended-services.md)]

The `pgvector` extension adds an open-source vector similarity search to PostgreSQL.

This article explores the limitations and tradeoffs of [`pgvector`](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) and shows how to use partitioning, indexing and search settings to improve performance.

For more on the extension itself, see [basics of `pgvector`](howto-use-pgvector.md). You may also want to refer to the official [README](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector/blob/master/README.md) of the project.
