# How to view metrics in Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL

[!INCLUDE [Note - Recommended services](includes/note-recommended-services.md)]

Resource metrics are available for every node of a cluster, and in aggregate across the nodes.

## View metrics

To access metrics for a cluster, open **Metrics**
under **Monitoring** in the Azure portal.

Choose a dimension and an aggregation, for instance **CPU percent** and
**Max**, to view the metric aggregated across all nodes. For an explanation of
each metric, see [here](concepts-monitoring.md#list-of-metrics).

### View metrics per node

Viewing each node's metrics separately on the same graph is called *splitting*.
To enable splitting, select **Apply splitting**, and then select the value by which to split. For nodes, choose **Server name**.

The metrics will now be plotted in one color-coded line per node.
