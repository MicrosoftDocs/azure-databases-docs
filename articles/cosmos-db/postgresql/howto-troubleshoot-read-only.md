# Troubleshoot read-only access to Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL

[!INCLUDE [Note - Recommended services](includes/note-recommended-services.md)]

PostgreSQL can't run on a machine without some free disk space. To maintain
access to PostgreSQL servers, it's necessary to prevent the disk space from
running out.

In Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL, nodes are set to a read-only (RO) state when the disk is
almost full. Preventing writes stops the disk from continuing to fill, and
keeps the node available for reads. During the read-only state, you can take
measures to free more disk space.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Even in the RO state in-flight transactions may continue writing to the database 
> thus decreasing further available storage. If available storage size continues 
> to decrease after the node was set to read-only, all existing sessions 
> would be disconnected and uncommitted transactions would be rolled back.

## Ways to recover write-access

If a node was set to RO state, you need to free some disk space to unblock writes on the node. Write access is re-enabled when node has more than 16 GiB of free storage on nodes with 256 GiB or greater and more than 7% of free storage on nodes with 128 GiB or smaller storage.

### On the coordinator node

* [Increase storage
  size](howto-scale-grow.md#increase-storage-on-nodes)
  on the coordinator node, and/or
* Distribute local tables to worker nodes, or drop data. You'll need to run
  `SET SESSION CHARACTERISTICS AS TRANSACTION READ WRITE` after you've
  connected to the database and before you execute other commands.

### On a worker node

* [Increase storage
  size](howto-scale-grow.md#increase-storage-on-nodes)
  on the worker nodes, and/or
* [Rebalance data](howto-scale-rebalance.md) to other nodes, or drop
  some data.
	* You'll need to set the worker node as read-write temporarily. You can
	  connect directly to worker nodes and use `SET SESSION CHARACTERISTICS` as
	  described above for the coordinator node.

## Prevention

We recommend that you set up an alert to notify you when server storage is
approaching the threshold. That way you can act early to avoid getting into the
read-only state. For more information, see the documentation about [recommended
alerts](howto-alert-on-metric.md#suggested-alerts).

## Next steps

* [Set up Azure
  alerts](howto-alert-on-metric.md#suggested-alerts)
  for advance notice so you can take action before reaching the read-only state.
* Learn about [disk
  usage](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/diskusage.html) in PostgreSQL
  documentation.
* Learn about [session
  characteristics](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/sql-set-transaction.html)
  in PostgreSQL documentation.
