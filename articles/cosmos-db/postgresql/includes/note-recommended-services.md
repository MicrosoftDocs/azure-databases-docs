> Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL is on a retirement path and no longer recommended for new projects. Instead, use one of these two services:
>
> - For *PostgreSQL* workloads: use the [Elastic Clusters feature of Azure Database For PostgreSQL](/azure/postgresql/elastic-clusters/concepts-elastic-clusters) to use the horizontal scale-out and distributed PostgreSQL features contained within the open source Citus extension.
>
> - For *NoSQL* workloads, use [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](../../nosql/overview.md) for a distributed database solution that includes a 99.999% availability service level agreement (SLA), instant autoscale, and automatic failover across multiple regions.
