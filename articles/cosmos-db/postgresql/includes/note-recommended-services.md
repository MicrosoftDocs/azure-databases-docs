> Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL is no longer supported for new projects. Don't use this service for new projects. Instead, use one of these two services:
>
> - Use [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](../../nosql/overview.md) for a distributed database solution designed for **high-scale** scenarios with a 99.999% availability service level agreement (SLA), instant autoscale, and automatic failover across multiple regions.
>
> - Use the [Elastic Clusters feature of Azure Database For PostgreSQL](../../../postgresql/flexible-server/concepts-elastic-clusters.md) for sharded PostgreSQL using the open-source Citus extension.
