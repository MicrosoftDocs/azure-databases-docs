# Azure Cosmos DB integrations for AI applications

Azure Cosmos DB integrates seamlessly with popular AI and large language model (LLM) orchestration frameworks to help you build intelligent applications. This article provides an overview of the available integrations with Semantic Kernel, LangChain, and LlamaIndex, along with links to their respective connectors and documentation.

## Integrations

| | Description | Azure Cosmos DB Resources | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| **[Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel)** | An open-source framework by Microsoft that combines AI agents with languages like C#, Python, and Java, enabling seamless orchestration of code and AI models. | [Python Connector](/semantic-kernel/concepts/vector-store-connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/azure-cosmosdb-nosql-connector?pivots=programming-language-python) <br> [.NET Connector](/semantic-kernel/concepts/vector-store-connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/azure-cosmosdb-nosql-connector?pivots=programming-language-csharp) |
| **[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)** | A framework that simplifies the creation of applications powered by large language models (LLMs), offering tools for context-aware reasoning applications in Python, JavaScript, and Java. | [Python](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/azure_cosmos_db_no_sql/) <br> [JavaScript](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/azure_cosmosdb_nosql/) <br> [Java](https://docs.langchain4j.dev/integrations/embedding-stores/azure-cosmos-nosql/) | 
| **[LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/)** | A framework for building context-augmented AI applications that can integrate private or domain-specific data with LLMs for complex workflows. | [Python](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/vector_stores/AzureCosmosDBNoSqlDemo/) |
