# Vector embeddings in Azure Cosmos DB

Vectors, also known as embeddings or vector embeddings, are mathematical representations of data in a high-dimensional space. They represent various types of information, such as text, images, and audio, in a format that machine learning models can process.

When an AI model receives text input, it first tokenizes the text into tokens. Each token is then converted into its corresponding embedding. This conversion process can be done using an embedding generation model, such as [Azure OpenAI embeddings](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/embeddings) or [Hugging Face on Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/hugging-face-on-azure).

The model processes these embeddings through multiple layers, capturing complex patterns and relationships within the text. The output embeddings can then be converted back into tokens if needed, generating readable text.

## Vectors

Each embedding is a vector of floating-point numbers, such that the distance between two embeddings in the vector space is correlated with semantic similarity between two inputs in the original format. For example, if two texts are similar, then their vector representations should also be similar. These high-dimensional representations capture semantic meaning, making it easier to perform tasks like searching, clustering, and classifying.

Here are two examples of texts represented as vectors:

## Dimensions and closeness

Each box containing floating-point numbers corresponds to a dimension, and each dimension corresponds to a feature or attribute that might be comprehensible to humans. Large language model (LLM) text embeddings typically have a few thousand dimensions, while more complex data models might have tens of thousands of dimensions.

Between the two vectors in the preceding example, some dimensions are similar while other dimensions are different, which are due to the similarities and differences in the meaning of the two phrases.

This image shows the spatial closeness of vectors that are similar, contrasting vectors that are drastically different:
