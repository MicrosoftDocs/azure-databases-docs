# Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB (7.0 server version): Supported features and syntax

[!INCLUDE[MongoDB](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/cosmos-db/includes/appliesto-mongodb.md)]

Azure Cosmos DB is the Microsoft globally distributed multi-model database service. Azure Cosmos DB offers [multiple database APIs](../choose-api.md). You can communicate with Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB by using any of the open-source MongoDB client [drivers](https://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers). Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB supports the use of existing client drivers by adhering to the MongoDB [wire protocol](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/mongodb-wire-protocol).

By using Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB, you can enjoy the benefits of MongoDB that you're used to, with all of the enterprise capabilities that Azure Cosmos DB provides: [global distribution](../distribute-data-globally.md), [automatic sharding](../partitioning-overview.md), availability and latency guarantees, encryption at rest, backups, and much more.

## Protocol support

The supported operators and any limitations or exceptions are listed in this article. Any client driver that understands these protocols should be able to connect to Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB. When you create Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB accounts, the 3.6+ version of accounts has an endpoint in the format `*.mongo.cosmos.azure.com`. The 3.2 version of accounts has an endpoint in the format `*.documents.azure.com`.

> [!NOTE]
> This article lists only the supported server commands, and excludes client-side wrapper functions. Client-side wrapper functions such as `deleteMany()` and `updateMany()` internally use the `delete()` and `update()` server commands. Functions that use supported server commands are compatible with Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB.

## Query language support

Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB provides comprehensive support for MongoDB query language constructs. In the following sections, you can find the detailed list of currently supported operations, operators, stages, commands, and options.

## Database commands

## Data types

Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB supports documents that are encoded in MongoDB BSON format. Versions 4.0 and later (4.0+) enhance the internal usage of this format to improve performance and reduce costs. Documents that are written or updated through an endpoint running 4.0+ benefit from this optimization.

In an [upgrade scenario](upgrade-version.md), documents that were written prior to the upgrade to version 4.0+ won't benefit from the enhanced performance until they're updated via a write operation through the 4.0+ endpoint.

16-MB document support raises the size limit for your documents from 2 MB to 16 MB. This limit applies only to collections that are created after this feature is enabled. When this feature is enabled for your database account, it can't be disabled.

To enable 16-MB document support, change the setting on the **Features** tab for the resource in the Azure portal or programmatically [add the `EnableMongo16MBDocumentSupport` capability](how-to-configure-capabilities.md).

We recommend that you enable Server Side Retry and avoid using wildcard indexes to ensure that requests in larger documents succeed. Raising your database or collection request units might also help performance.

| Command      | Supported                               |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `expr`       | Yes                                     |
| `jsonSchema` | No                                      |
| `mod`        | Yes                                     |
| `regex`      | Yes                                     |
| `text`       | No (Not supported. Use `$regex` instead.) |
| `where`      | No                                      |

In `$regex` queries, left-anchored expressions allow index search. However, using the `i` modifier (case-insensitivity) and the `m` modifier (multiline) causes the collection to scan in all expressions.

When there's a need to include `$` or `|`, it's best to create two (or more) `$regex` queries.

For example, change the following original query:

`find({x:{$regex: /^abc$/})`

To this query:

`find({x:{$regex: /^abc/, x:{$regex:/^abc$/}})`

The first part of the modified query uses the index to restrict the search to documents that begin with `^abc`. The second part of the query matches the exact entries. The bar operator (`|`) acts as an "or" function. The query `find({x:{$regex: /^abc |^def/})` matches the documents in which field `x` has values that begin with `abc` or `def`. To use the index, we recommend that you break the query into two different queries that are joined by the `$or` operator: `find( {$or : [{x: $regex: /^abc/}, {$regex: /^def/}] })`.

## Sort operations

When you use the `findOneAndUpdate` operation, sort operations on a single field are supported. Sort operations on multiple fields aren't supported.

## Indexing

The API for MongoDB [supports various indexes](indexing.md) to enable sorting on multiple fields, improve query performance, and enforce uniqueness.

## Client-side field-level encryption

Client-level field encryption is a driver feature and is compatible with the API for MongoDB. Explicit encryption, in which the driver explicitly encrypts each field when it's written, is supported. Automatic encryption isn't supported. Explicit decryption and automatic decryption is supported.

The `mongocryptd` shouldn't be run because it isn't needed to perform any of the supported operations.

## GridFS

Azure Cosmos DB supports GridFS through any GridFS-compatible Mongo driver.

## Replication

Azure Cosmos DB supports automatic, native replication at the lowest layers. This logic is also extended to achieve low-latency, global replication. Azure Cosmos DB doesn't support manual replication commands.

## Retryable writes

The retryable writes feature enables MongoDB drivers to automatically retry certain write operations. The feature results in more stringent requirements for certain operations, which match MongoDB protocol requirements. With this feature enabled, update operations, including deletes, in sharded collections require the shard key to be included in the query filter or update statement.

For example, with a sharded collection that's sharded on the `"country"` key, to delete all the documents that have the field `"city" = "NYC"`, the application needs to execute the operation for all shard key (`"country"`) values if the retryable writes feature is enabled.

- `db.coll.deleteMany({"country": "USA", "city": "NYC"})` - **Success**
- `db.coll.deleteMany({"city": "NYC"})` - Fails with error **ShardKeyNotFound(61)**

> [!NOTE]
> Retryable writes does not support bulk unordered writes at this time. If you want to perform bulk writes with retryable writes enabled, perform bulk ordered writes.

To enable the feature, [add the EnableMongoRetryableWrites capability](how-to-configure-capabilities.md) to your database account. This feature can also be enabled on the **Features** tab in the Azure portal.

## Sharding

Azure Cosmos DB supports automatic, server-side sharding. It automatically manages shard creation, placement, and balancing. Azure Cosmos DB doesn't support manual sharding commands, which means that you don't have to invoke commands like `addShard`, `balancerStart`, and `moveChunk`. You need to specify the shard key only when you create the containers or query the data.

## Sessions

Azure Cosmos DB doesn't yet support server-side sessions commands.

## Time to Live

Azure Cosmos DB supports a Time to Live (TTL) that's based on the time stamp of the document. You can enable TTL for a collection in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

### Custom TTL

This feature provides the ability to set a custom TTL on any one field in a collection.

On a collection that has TTL enabled on a field:

- Acceptable types are the BSON data type and numeric types (integer, long, or double), which will be interpreted as a Unix millisecond time stamp to determine expiration.

- If the TTL field is an array, then the smallest element of the array that is of an acceptable type is considered for document expiry.

- If the TTL field is missing from a document, the document doesn’t expire.

- If the TTL field isn't an acceptable type, the document doesn't expire.

#### Limitations of a custom TTL

- Only one field in a collection can have a TTL set on it.

- With a custom TTL field set, the `\_ts` field can't be used for document expiration.

- You can't use the `\_ts` field in addition.

#### Configuration

You can enable a custom TTL by updating the `EnableTtlOnCustomPath` capability for the account. Learn [how to configure capabilities](../../cosmos-db/mongodb/how-to-configure-capabilities.md).

### Set up the TTL

To set up the TTL, run this command: `db.coll.createIndex({"YOUR_CUSTOM_TTL_FIELD":1}, {expireAfterSeconds: 10})`

## Transactions

Multi-document transactions are supported within an unsharded collection. Multi-document transactions aren't supported across collections or in sharded collections. The timeout for transactions is a fixed 5 seconds.

## Manage users and roles

Azure Cosmos DB doesn't yet support users and roles. However, Azure Cosmos DB supports Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) and read-write and read-only passwords and keys that can be obtained through the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) (on the **Connection Strings** page).

## Write concerns

Some applications rely on a [write concern](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/write-concern/), which specifies the number of responses that are required during a write operation. Due to how Azure Cosmos DB handles replication in the background, all writes are automatically Quorum by default. Any write concern that's specified by the client code is ignored.
