# Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB (4.0 server version): supported features and syntax

[!INCLUDE[MongoDB](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/cosmos-db/includes/appliesto-mongodb.md)]

Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft's globally distributed multi-model database service. You can communicate with the Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB using any of the open-source MongoDB client [drivers](https://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers). The Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB enables the use of existing client drivers by adhering to the MongoDB [wire protocol](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/mongodb-wire-protocol).

By using the Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB, you can enjoy the benefits of the MongoDB you're used to, with all of the enterprise capabilities that Azure Cosmos DB provides: [global distribution](../distribute-data-globally.md), [automatic sharding](../partitioning-overview.md), availability and latency guarantees, encryption at rest, backups, and much more.

## Protocol Support

The supported operators and any limitations or exceptions are listed below. Any client driver that understands these protocols should be able to connect to Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB. When you create Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB accounts, the 3.6+ versions of accounts have the endpoint in the format `*.mongo.cosmos.azure.com` whereas the 3.2 version of accounts has the endpoint in the format `*.documents.azure.com`.

> [!NOTE]
> This article only lists the supported server commands and excludes client-side wrapper functions. Client-side wrapper functions such as `deleteMany()` and `updateMany()` internally utilize the `delete()` and `update()` server commands. Functions utilizing supported server commands are compatible with Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB.

## Data types

Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB supports documents encoded in MongoDB BSON format. The 4.0 API version enhances the internal usage of this format to improve performance and reduce costs. Documents written or updated through an endpoint running 4.0+ benefit from optimization.

In an [upgrade scenario](upgrade-version.md), documents written prior to the upgrade to version 4.0+ won't benefit from the enhanced performance until they're updated via a write operation through the 4.0+ endpoint.

16-MB document support raises the size limit for your documents from 2 MB to 16 MB. This limit only applies to collections created after this feature has been enabled. Once this feature is enabled for your database account, it can't be disabled.

Enabling 16 MB can be done in the features tab in the Azure portal or programmatically by [adding the "EnableMongo16MBDocumentSupport" capability](how-to-configure-capabilities.md).

We recommend enabling Server Side Retry and avoiding wildcard indexes to ensure requests with larger documents succeed. If necessary, raising your DB/Collection RUs may also help performance.

| Command | Supported |
|---------|---------|
| `Double` | Yes |
| `String` | Yes |
| `Object` | Yes |
| `Array` | Yes |
| `Binary Data` | Yes |
| `ObjectId` | Yes |

| `32-bit Integer (int)` | Yes |
| `Timestamp` | Yes |
| `64-bit Integer (long)` | Yes |
| `MinKey` | Yes |
| `MaxKey` | Yes |
| `Decimal128` | Yes |
| `Regular Expression` | Yes |
| `JavaScript` | Yes |
| `JavaScript (with scope)` | Yes |
| `Undefined` | Yes |

## Indexes and index properties

### Indexes

| Command | Supported |
|---------|---------|
| `Single Field Index` | Yes |
| `Compound Index` | Yes |
| `Multikey Index` | Yes |
| `Text Index` | No |
| `2dsphere` | Yes |
| `2d Index` | No |
| `Hashed Index` | No |

### Index properties

| Command | Supported |
|---------|---------|
| `TTL` | Yes |
| `Unique` | Yes |
| `Partial` | No |
| `Case Insensitive` | No |
| `Sparse` | No |
| `Background` | Yes |

## Operators

### Logical operators

| Command | Supported |
|---------|---------|
| `or` | Yes |
| `and` | Yes |
| `not` | Yes |
| `nor` | Yes |

### Element operators

| Command | Supported |
|---------|---------|
| `exists` | Yes |
| `type` | Yes |

### Evaluation query operators

| Command | Supported |
|---------|---------|
| `expr` | Yes |
| `jsonSchema` | No |
| `mod` | Yes |
| `regex` | Yes |
| `text` | No (Not supported. Use $regex instead.) |
| `where` | No |

In the $regex queries, left-anchored expressions allow index search. However, using 'i' modifier (case-insensitivity) and 'm' modifier (multiline) causes the collection scan in all expressions.

When there's a need to include '$' or '|', it's best to create two (or more) regex queries. For example, given the following original query: `find({x:{$regex: /^abc$/})`, it has to be modified as follows:

`find({x:{$regex: /^abc/, x:{$regex:/^abc$/}})`

The first part will use the index to restrict the search to those documents beginning with ^abc and the second part will match the exact entries. The bar operator '|' acts as an "or" function - the query `find({x:{$regex: /^abc |^def/})` matches the documents in which field 'x' has values that begin with "abc" or "def". To utilize the index, it's recommended to break the query into two different queries joined by the $or operator: `find( {$or : [{x: $regex: /^abc/}, {$regex: /^def/}] })`.

### Array operators

| Command | Supported |
|---------|---------|
| `all` | Yes |
| `elemMatch` | Yes |
| `size` | Yes |

| `$geometry` | Yes |
| `$minDistance` | Yes |
| `$maxDistance` | Yes |
| `$center` | No |
| `$centerSphere` | No |
| `$box` | No |
| `$polygon` | No |

## Sort operations

When you use the `findOneAndUpdate` operation with API for MongoDB version 4.0, sort operations on a single field and multiple fields are supported. Sort operations on multiple fields were a limitation of previous wire protocols.

## Indexing

The API for MongoDB [supports various indexes](indexing.md) to enable sorting on multiple fields, improve query performance, and enforce uniqueness.

## GridFS

Azure Cosmos DB supports GridFS through any GridFS-compatible Mongo driver.

## Replication

Azure Cosmos DB supports automatic, native replication at the lowest layers. This logic is extended out to achieve low-latency, global replication as well. Azure Cosmos DB doesn't support manual replication commands.

## Retryable Writes

Retryable writes enable MongoDB drivers to automatically retry certain write operations if there was failure, but results in more stringent requirements for certain operations, which match MongoDB protocol requirements. With this feature enabled, update operations, including deletes, in sharded collections will require the shard key to be included in the query filter or update statement.

For example, with a sharded collection, sharded on key “country”: To delete all the documents with the field **city** = `"NYC"`, the application will need to execute the operation for all shard key (country) values if Retryable writes are enabled.

- `db.coll.deleteMany({"country": "USA", "city": "NYC"})` - **Success**
- `db.coll.deleteMany({"city": "NYC"})` - Fails with error **ShardKeyNotFound(61)**

> [!NOTE]
> Retryable writes does not support bulk unordered writes at this time. If you would like to perform bulk writes with retryable writes enabled, perform bulk ordered writes.

To enable the feature, [add the EnableMongoRetryableWrites capability](how-to-configure-capabilities.md) to your database account. This feature can also be enabled in the features tab in the Azure portal.

## Sharding

Azure Cosmos DB supports automatic, server-side sharding. It manages shard creation, placement, and balancing automatically. Azure Cosmos DB doesn't support manual sharding commands, which means you don't have to invoke commands such as addShard, balancerStart, moveChunk etc. You only need to specify the shard key while creating the containers or querying the data.

## Sessions

Azure Cosmos DB doesn't yet support server-side sessions commands.

## Time-to-live (TTL)

Azure Cosmos DB supports a time-to-live (TTL) based on the timestamp of the document. TTL can be enabled for collections from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

## Transactions

Multi-document transactions are supported within an unsharded collection. Multi-document transactions aren't supported across collections or in sharded collections. The timeout for transactions is a fixed 5 seconds.

## User and role management

Azure Cosmos DB doesn't yet support users and roles. However, Azure Cosmos DB supports Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) and read-write and read-only passwords/keys that can be obtained through the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) (Connection String page).

## Write Concern

Some applications rely on a [Write Concern](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/write-concern/), which specifies the number of responses required during a write operation. Due to how Azure Cosmos DB handles replication in the background all writes are automatically Quorum by default. Any write concern specified by the client code is ignored.
