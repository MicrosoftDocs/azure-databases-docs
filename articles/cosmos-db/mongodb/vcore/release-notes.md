This release contains enhancements to the **Explain** plan and various vector filtering abilities.

- The API for MongoDB vCore allows filtering by metadata columns while performing vector searches.
- The `Explain` plan offers two different modes

  | | Description |
  | --- | --- |
  | **`allShardsQueryPlan`** | This mode is a new explain mode to view the query plan for all shards involved in the query execution. This mode offers a comprehensive perspective for distributed queries. |
  | **`allShardsExecution`** | This mode presents an alternative explain mode to inspect the execution details across all shards involved in the query. This mode provides you with comprehensive information to use in performance optimization. |

- Free tier support is available in more regions. These regions now include **East US 2**. For more information, see [Azure Cosmos DB pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cosmos-db/mongodb/).

- The ability to build indexes in the background is now available in preview.
