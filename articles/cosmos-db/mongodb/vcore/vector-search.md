# Vector store in Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore

Use the Integrated Vector Database in Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB (vCore) to seamlessly connect your AI-based applications with your data that's stored in Azure Cosmos DB. This integration can include apps that you built by using [Azure OpenAI embeddings](/azure/ai-services/openai/tutorials/embeddings). The natively integrated vector database enables you to efficiently store, index, and query high-dimensional vector data that's stored directly in Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB (vCore), along with the original data from which the vector data is created. It eliminates the need to transfer your data to alternative vector stores and incur additional costs.

## What is a vector store?

A vector store or [vector database](../../vector-database.md) is a database designed to store and manage vector embeddings, which are mathematical representations of data in a high-dimensional space. In this space, each dimension corresponds to a feature of the data, and tens of thousands of dimensions might be used to represent sophisticated data. A vector's position in this space represents its characteristics. Words, phrases, or entire documents, and images, audio, and other types of data can all be vectorized. 

## How does a vector store work?

In a vector store, vector search algorithms are used to index and query embeddings. Some well-known vector search algorithms include Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW), Inverted File (IVF), DiskANN, etc. Vector search is a method that helps you find similar items based on their data characteristics rather than by exact matches on a property field. This technique is useful in applications such as searching for similar text, finding related images, making recommendations, or even detecting anomalies. It is used to query the [vector embeddings](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/understand-embeddings) (lists of numbers) of your data that you created by using a machine learning model by using an embeddings API. Examples of embeddings APIs are [Azure OpenAI Embeddings](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/embeddings) or [Hugging Face on Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/hugging-face-on-azure/). Vector search measures the distance between the data vectors and your query vector. The data vectors that are closest to your query vector are the ones that are found to be most similar semantically.

In the Integrated Vector Database in Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB (vCore), embeddings can be stored, indexed, and queried alongside the original data. This approach eliminates the extra cost of replicating data in a separate pure vector database. Moreover, this architecture keeps the vector embeddings and original data together, which better facilitates multi-modal data operations, and enables greater data consistency, scale, and performance.

## Perform Vector Similarity search

Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB (vCore) provides robust vector search capabilities, allowing you to perform high-speed similarity searches across complex datasets. To perform vector search in Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB, you first need to create a vector index. Cosmos DB currently supports three types of vector indexes:

- **DiskANN (Recommended)**: Ideal for large-scale datasets, leveraging SSDs for efficient memory usage while maintaining high recall in approximate nearest-neighbor (ANN) searches.
- **HNSW**: Suited for moderate-sized datasets needing high recall, with a graph-based structure that balances accuracy and resource efficiency.
- **IVF**: Uses clustering to optimize search speed in expansive datasets, focusing searches within targeted clusters to accelerate performance.

### [DiskANN (preview)](#tab/diskann)

DiskANN indexes are available on M40 tiers and above. To create the DiskANN index, set the `"kind"` parameter to `"vector-diskann"` following the template below:

```javascript
{ 
    "createIndexes": "<collection_name>",
    "indexes": [
        {
            "name": "<index_name>",
            "key": {
                "<path_to_property>": "cosmosSearch"
            },
            "cosmosSearchOptions": { 
                "kind": "vector-diskann", 
                "dimensions": <integer_value>,
                "similarity": <string_value>,
                "maxDegree" : <integer_value>, 
                "lBuild" : <integer_value>, 
            } 
        } 
    ] 
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `index_name` | string | Unique name of the index. |
| `path_to_property` | string | Path to the property that contains the vector. This path can be a top-level property or a dot notation path to the property. Vectors must be a `number[]` to be indexed and used in vector search results. Using another type, such as `double[]`,  prevents the document from being indexed. Non-indexed documents won't be returned in the result of a vector search. |
| `kind` | string | Type of vector index to create. The options are `vector-ivf`, `vector-hnsw`, and `vector-diskann`. |
| `dimensions` | integer | Number of dimensions for vector similarity. DiskANN supports up to 2000 dimensions, with future support planned for 40,000+. |
| `similarity` | string | Similarity metric to use with the index. Possible options are `COS` (cosine distance), `L2` (Euclidean distance), and `IP` (inner product). |
| `maxDegree` | integer | Maximum number of edges per node in the graph. This parameter ranges from 20 to 2048 (default is 32). Higher `maxDegree` is suitable for datasets with high dimensionality and/or high accuracy requirements. |
| `lBuild` | integer | Sets the number of candidate neighbors evaluated during DiskANN index construction. This parameter, which ranges from 10 to 500 (default is 50), balances accuracy and computational overhead: higher values improve index quality and accuracy but increase build time |

### Perform a vector search with DiskANN

To perform a vector search, use the `$search` aggregation pipeline stage, and query with the `cosmosSearch` operator. DiskANN allows high-performance searches across massive datasets with **optional** filtering such as geospatial or text-based filters.

```javascript
{
  "$search": {
    "cosmosSearch": {
      "path": "<path_to_property>",
      "query": "<query_vector>",  
      "k": <num_results_to_return>,  
      "filter": {"$and": [
        { "<attribute_1>": { "$eq": <value> } },
        {"<location_attribute>": {"$geoWithin": {"$centerSphere":[[<longitude_integer_value>, <latitude_integer_value>], <radius>]}}}
      ]}
    }
  }
},
```

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lSearch` | integer | Specifies the size of the dynamic candidate list for search. The default value is `40`, with a configurable range from `10` to `1000`. Increasing the value enhances recall but may reduce search speed. |
| `k` | integer | Defines the number of search results to return. The `k` value must be less than or equal to `lSearch`. |

### Enabling DiskANN on a new cluster

To enable **DiskANN** Vector Index on a newly provisioned Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB (vCore) cluster, follow these steps to perform a cluster-level registration via the Azure CLI:
1. Log in to Azure CLI
```bash
az login
```

2. Retrieve the current settings for the feature flags on your cluster. This ensures you retain any existing flags while adding the new feature.
```bash
az resource show --ids "/subscriptions/<sub id>/resourceGroups/<resource group name>/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDB/mongoClusters/<resource name of your Cosmos DB for MongoDB cluster>" --api-version <cluster's api version>
```

3. Add the `DiskANNIndex` flag to the list of preview features **without removing any existing ones**.
```bash
az resource patch --ids "/subscriptions/<sub id>/resourceGroups/<resource group name>/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDB/mongoClusters/<resource name of your Cosmos DB for MongoDB cluster>" --api-version <cluster's api version> --properties "{\"previewFeatures\": [\"GeoReplicas\", \"DiskANNIndex\"]}" 
```

## Example using a DiskANN Index with Filtering

### Add vectors to your database

To use vector search with geospatial filters, add documents that include both vector embeddings and location coordinates. You can create the [embeddings](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/understand-embeddings) by using your own model, [Azure OpenAI Embeddings](/azure/cognitive-services/openai/tutorials/embeddings), or another API (such as [Hugging Face on Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/hugging-face-on-azure/)).

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient

client = MongoClient("<your_connection_string>")
db = client["test"]
collection = db["testCollection"]

documents = [
    {"name": "Eugenia Lopez", "bio": "CEO of AdventureWorks", "is_open": 1, "location": [-118.9865, 34.0145], "contentVector": [0.52, 0.20, 0.23]},
    {"name": "Cameron Baker", "bio": "CFO of AdventureWorks", "is_open": 1, "location": [-0.1278, 51.5074], "contentVector": [0.55, 0.89, 0.44]},
    {"name": "Jessie Irwin", "bio": "Director of Our Planet initiative", "is_open": 0, "location": [-118.9865, 33.9855], "contentVector": [0.13, 0.92, 0.85]},
    {"name": "Rory Nguyen", "bio": "President of Our Planet initiative", "is_open": 1, "location": [-119.0000, 33.9855], "contentVector": [0.91, 0.76, 0.83]}
]

collection.insert_many(documents)
```

### Create a DiskANN vector index

The following example demonstrates how to set up a DiskANN vector index with filtering capabilities. This includes creating the vector index for similarity search, adding documents with vector and geospatial properties, and indexing fields for additional filtering.

```python
db.command({
    "createIndexes": "testCollection",
    "indexes": [
        {
            "name": "DiskANNVectorIndex",
            "key": {
                "contentVector": "cosmosSearch"
            },
            "cosmosSearchOptions": {
                "kind": "vector-diskann",
                "dimensions": 3,
                "similarity": "COS",
                "maxDegree": 32,
                "lBuild": 64
            }
        },
        { 
            "name": "is_open",
            "key": { 
                "is_open": 1 
            }      
        },
        {
            "name": "locationIndex",
            "key": {
                "location": 1
            }
        }
    ]
})
```

This command creates a DiskANN vector index on the `contentVector` field in `exampleCollection`, enabling similarity searches. It also adds:
- An index on the `is_open` field, allowing you to filter results based on whether businesses are open.
- A geospatial index on the `location` field to filter by geographic proximity.

### Perform a Vector Search

To find documents with similar vectors within a specific geographic radius, specify the `queryVector` for similarity search and include a geospatial filter.

```python
query_vector = [0.52, 0.28, 0.12]
pipeline = [
    {
        "$search": {
            "cosmosSearch": {
                "path": "contentVector",
                "vector": query_vector,
                "k": 5,
                "filter": {
                    "$and": [
                        {"is_open": {"$eq": 1}},
                        {"location": {"$geoWithin": {"$centerSphere": [[-119.7192861804, 34.4102485028], 100 / 3963.2]}}}
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    }
]

results = list(collection.aggregate(pipeline))
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

In this example, the vector similarity search returns the top `k` closest vectors based on the specified `COS` similarity metric, while filtering results to include only open businesses within a 100-mile radius.

```python
[
  {
    similarityScore: 0.9745354109084544,
    document: {
      _id: ObjectId("645acb54413be5502badff94"),
      name: 'Eugenia Lopez',
      bio: 'CEO of AdventureWorks',
      is_open: 1,
      location: [-118.9865, 34.0145],
      contentVector: [0.52, 0.20, 0.23]
    }
  },
  {
    similarityScore: 0.9006955671333992,
    document: {
      _id: ObjectId("645acb54413be5502badff97"),
      name: 'Rory Nguyen',
      bio: 'President of Our Planet initiative',
      is_open: 1,
      location: [-119.7302, 34.4005],
      contentVector: [0.91, 0.76, 0.83]
    }
  }
]
```

This result shows the top similar documents to `queryVector`, constrained to a 100-mile radius and open businesses. Each result includes the similarity score and metadata, demonstrating how DiskANN in Cosmos DB for MongoDB supports combined vector and geospatial queries for enriched, location-sensitive search experiences.

### [HNSW](#tab/hnsw)

You can create HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) indexes on M40 cluster tiers and higher. To create the HSNW index, you need to create a vector index with the `"kind"` parameter set to `"vector-hnsw"` following the template below:

```javascript
{ 
    "createIndexes": "<collection_name>",
    "indexes": [
        {
            "name": "<index_name>",
            "key": {
                "<path_to_property>": "cosmosSearch"
            },
            "cosmosSearchOptions": { 
                "kind": "vector-hnsw", 
                "m": <integer_value>, 
                "efConstruction": <integer_value>, 
                "similarity": "<string_value>", 
                "dimensions": <integer_value> 
            } 
        } 
    ] 
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `m` | integer | The max number of connections per layer (`16` by default, minimum value is `2`, maximum value is `100`). Higher m is suitable for datasets with high dimensionality and/or high accuracy requirements. |
| `efConstruction` | integer | the size of the dynamic candidate list for constructing the graph (`64` by default, minimum value is `4`, maximum value is `1000`). Higher `efConstruction` will result in better index quality and higher accuracy, but it will also increase the time required to build the index. `efConstruction` has to be at least `2 * m` |

### Perform a vector search with HNSW

To perform a vector search, use the `$search` aggregation pipeline stage the query with the `cosmosSearch` operator.

```javascript
{
    "$search": {
        "cosmosSearch": {
            "vector": <query_vector>,
            "path": "<path_to_property>",
            "k": <num_results_to_return>,
            "efSearch": <integer_value>
        },
    }
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `efSearch` | integer | The size of the dynamic candidate list for search (`40` by default). A higher value provides better recall at the cost of speed. |

> [!NOTE]
> Creating an HSNW index with large datasets can result in your Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore resource running out of memory, or can limit the performance of other operations running on your database. If you encounter such issues, these can be mitigated by scaling your resource to a higher cluster tier, or creating a new DiskANN vector index.

## Example using an HNSW index

The following examples show you how to index vectors, add documents that have vector properties, perform a vector search, and retrieve the index configuration.

```javascript
use test;

db.createCollection("exampleCollection");

db.runCommand({ 
    "createIndexes": "exampleCollection",
    "indexes": [
        {
            "name": "VectorSearchIndex",
            "key": {
                "contentVector": "cosmosSearch"
            },
            "cosmosSearchOptions": { 
                "kind": "vector-hnsw", 
                "m": 16, 
                "efConstruction": 64, 
                "similarity": "COS", 
                "dimensions": 3
            } 
        } 
    ] 
});
```

This command creates an HNSW index against the `contentVector` property in the documents that are stored in the specified collection, `exampleCollection`. The `cosmosSearchOptions` property specifies the parameters for the HNSW vector index. If your document has the vector stored in a nested property, you can set this property by using a dot notation path. For example, you might use `text.contentVector` if `contentVector` is a subproperty of `text`.

### Add vectors to your database

To add vectors to your database's collection, you first need to create the [embeddings](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/understand-embeddings) by using your own model, [Azure OpenAI Embeddings](/azure/cognitive-services/openai/tutorials/embeddings), or another API (such as [Hugging Face on Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/hugging-face-on-azure/)). In this example, new documents are added through sample embeddings:

```javascript
db.exampleCollection.insertMany([
  {name: "Eugenia Lopez", bio: "Eugenia is the CEO of AdvenureWorks.", vectorContent: [0.51, 0.12, 0.23]},
  {name: "Cameron Baker", bio: "Cameron Baker CFO of AdvenureWorks.", vectorContent: [0.55, 0.89, 0.44]},
  {name: "Jessie Irwin", bio: "Jessie Irwin is the former CEO of AdventureWorks and now the director of the Our Planet initiative.", vectorContent: [0.13, 0.92, 0.85]},
  {name: "Rory Nguyen", bio: "Rory Nguyen is the founder of AdventureWorks and the president of the Our Planet initiative.", vectorContent: [0.91, 0.76, 0.83]},
]);
```

### Perform a vector search

Continuing with the last example, create another vector, `queryVector`. Vector search measures the distance between `queryVector` and the vectors in the `contentVector` path of your documents. You can set the number of results that the search returns by setting the parameter `k`, which is set to `2` here. You can also set `efSearch`, which is an integer that controls the size of the candidate vector list. A higher value may improve accuracy, however the search will be slower as a result. This is an optional parameter with a default value of 40.

```javascript
const queryVector = [0.52, 0.28, 0.12];
db.exampleCollection.aggregate([
  {
    "$search": {
        "cosmosSearch": {
            "vector": "queryVector",
            "path": "contentVector",
            "k": 2,
            "efSearch": 40
        },
    }
  }
}
]);
```

In this example, a vector search is performed by using `queryVector` as an input via the Mongo shell. The search result is a list of two items that are most similar to the query vector, sorted by their similarity scores.

```javascript
[
  {
    similarityScore: 0.9465376,
    document: {
      _id: ObjectId("645acb54413be5502badff94"),
      name: 'Eugenia Lopez',
      bio: 'Eugenia is the CEO of AdvenureWorks.',
      vectorContent: [ 0.51, 0.12, 0.23 ]
    }
  },
  {
    similarityScore: 0.9006955,
    document: {
      _id: ObjectId("645acb54413be5502badff97"),
      name: 'Rory Nguyen',
      bio: 'Rory Nguyen is the founder of AdventureWorks and the president of the Our Planet initiative.',
      vectorContent: [ 0.91, 0.76, 0.83 ]
    }
  }
]
```

### [IVF](#tab/IVF)

To create a vector index using the IVF (Inverted File) algorithm, use the following `createIndexes` template and set the `"kind"` parameter to `"vector-ivf"`:

```json
{
  "createIndexes": "<collection_name>",
  "indexes": [
    {
      "name": "<index_name>",
      "key": {
        "<path_to_property>": "cosmosSearch"
      },
      "cosmosSearchOptions": {
        "kind": "vector-ivf",
        "numLists": <integer_value>,
        "similarity": "<string_value>",
        "dimensions": <integer_value>
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `numLists` | integer | This integer is the number of clusters that the inverted file (IVF) index uses to group the vector data. We recommend that `numLists` is set to `documentCount/1000` for up to 1 million documents and to `sqrt(documentCount)` for more than 1 million documents. Using a `numLists` value of `1` is akin to performing brute-force search, which has limited performance. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Setting the _numLists_ parameter correctly is important for achieving good accuracy and performance. We recommend that `numLists` is set to `documentCount/1000` for up to 1 million documents. For more than 1 million documents, we recommend using DiskANN vector index for optimal results. 
>
> As the number of items in your database grows, you should tune _numLists_ to be larger in order to achieve good latency performance for vector search.
>
> If you're experimenting with a new scenario or creating a small demo, you can start with `numLists` set to `1` to perform a brute-force search across all vectors. This should provide you with the most accurate results from the vector search, however be aware that the search speed and latency will be slow. After your initial setup, you should go ahead and tune the `numLists` parameter using the above guidance.

### Perform a vector search with IVF

To perform a vector search, use the `$search` aggregation pipeline stage in a MongoDB query. To use the `cosmosSearch` index, use the new `cosmosSearch` operator.

```json
{
  {
  "$search": {
    "cosmosSearch": {
        "vector": <query_vector>,
        "path": "<path_to_property>",
        "k": <num_results_to_return>,
      },
      "returnStoredSource": True }},
  {
    "$project": { "<custom_name_for_similarity_score>": {
           "$meta": "searchScore" },
            "document" : "$$ROOT"
        }
  }
}
```

To retrieve the similarity score (`searchScore`) along with the documents found by the vector search, use the `$project` operator to include `searchScore` and rename it as `<custom_name_for_similarity_score>` in the results. Then the document is also projected as nested object. Note that the similarity score is calculated using the metric defined in the vector index.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Vectors must be a `number[]` to be indexed. Using another type, such as `double[]`,  prevents the document from being indexed. Non-indexed documents won't be returned in the result of a vector search.

## Example using an IVF Index

Inverted File (IVF) Indexing is a method that organizes vectors into clusters. During a vector search, the query vector is first compared against the centers of these clusters. The search is then conducted within the cluster whose center is closest to the query vector.

The `numList`s parameter determines the number of clusters to be created. A single cluster implies that the search is conducted against all vectors in the database, akin to a brute-force or kNN search. This setting provides the highest accuracy but also the highest latency.

Increasing the `numLists` value results in more clusters, each containing fewer vectors. For instance, if `numLists=2`, each cluster contains more vectors than if `numLists=3`, and so on. Fewer vectors per cluster speed up the search (lower latency, higher queries per second). However, this increases the likelihood of missing the most similar vector in your database to the query vector. This is due to the imperfect nature of clustering, where the search might focus on one cluster while the actual “closest” vector resides in a different cluster.

The `nProbes` parameter controls the number of clusters to be searched. By default, it’s set to 1, meaning it searches only the cluster with the center closest to the query vector. Increasing this value allows the search to cover more clusters, improving accuracy but also increasing latency (thus decreasing queries per second) as more clusters and vectors are being searched.

The following examples show you how to index vectors, add documents that have vector properties, perform a vector search, and retrieve the index configuration.

### Create a vector index

```javascript
use test;

db.createCollection("exampleCollection");

db.runCommand({
  createIndexes: 'exampleCollection',
  indexes: [
    {
      name: 'vectorSearchIndex',
      key: {
        "vectorContent": "cosmosSearch"
      },
      cosmosSearchOptions: {
        kind: 'vector-ivf',
        numLists: 3,
        similarity: 'COS',
        dimensions: 3
      }
    }
  ]
});
```

This command creates a `vector-ivf` index against the `vectorContent` property in the documents that are stored in the specified collection, `exampleCollection`. The `cosmosSearchOptions` property specifies the parameters for the IVF vector index. If your document has the vector stored in a nested property, you can set this property by using a dot notation path. For example, you might use `text.vectorContent` if `vectorContent` is a subproperty of `text`.

### Add vectors to your database

To add vectors to your database's collection, you first need to create the [embeddings](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/understand-embeddings) by using your own model, [Azure OpenAI Embeddings](/azure/cognitive-services/openai/tutorials/embeddings), or another API (such as [Hugging Face on Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/hugging-face-on-azure/)). In this example, new documents are added through sample embeddings:

```javascript
db.exampleCollection.insertMany([
  {name: "Eugenia Lopez", bio: "Eugenia is the CEO of AdvenureWorks.", vectorContent: [0.51, 0.12, 0.23]},
  {name: "Cameron Baker", bio: "Cameron Baker CFO of AdvenureWorks.", vectorContent: [0.55, 0.89, 0.44]},
  {name: "Jessie Irwin", bio: "Jessie Irwin is the former CEO of AdventureWorks and now the director of the Our Planet initiative.", vectorContent: [0.13, 0.92, 0.85]},
  {name: "Rory Nguyen", bio: "Rory Nguyen is the founder of AdventureWorks and the president of the Our Planet initiative.", vectorContent: [0.91, 0.76, 0.83]},
]);
```

### Perform a vector search

To perform a vector search, use the `$search` aggregation pipeline stage in a MongoDB query. To use the `cosmosSearch` index, use the new `cosmosSearch` operator.

```json
{
  {
  "$search": {
    "cosmosSearch": {
        "vector": <vector_to_search>,
        "path": "<path_to_property>",
        "k": <num_results_to_return>,
      },
      "returnStoredSource": True }},
  {
    "$project": { "<custom_name_for_similarity_score>": {
           "$meta": "searchScore" },
            "document" : "$$ROOT"
        }
  }
}
```

To retrieve the similarity score (`searchScore`) along with the documents found by the vector search, use the `$project` operator to include `searchScore` and rename it as `<custom_name_for_similarity_score>` in the results. Then the document is also projected as nested object. Note that the similarity score is calculated using the metric defined in the vector index.

### Query vectors and vector distances (aka similarity scores) using $search"

Continuing with the last example, create another vector, `queryVector`. Vector search measures the distance between `queryVector` and the vectors in the `vectorContent` path of your documents. You can set the number of results that the search returns by setting the parameter `k`, which is set to `2` here. You can also set `nProbes`, which is an integer that controls the number of nearby clusters that are inspected in each search. A higher value may improve accuracy, however the search will be slower as a result. This is an optional parameter with a default value of 1 and cannot be larger than the `numLists` value specified in the vector index.

```javascript
const queryVector = [0.52, 0.28, 0.12];
db.exampleCollection.aggregate([
  {
    $search: {
      "cosmosSearch": {
        "vector": queryVector,
        "path": "vectorContent",
        "k": 2
      },
    "returnStoredSource": true }},
  {
    "$project": { "similarityScore": {
           "$meta": "searchScore" },
            "document" : "$$ROOT"
        }
  }
]);
```

In this example, a vector search is performed by using `queryVector` as an input via the Mongo shell. The search result is a list of two items that are most similar to the query vector, sorted by their similarity scores.

```javascript
[
  {
    similarityScore: 0.9465376,
    document: {
      _id: ObjectId("645acb54413be5502badff94"),
      name: 'Eugenia Lopez',
      bio: 'Eugenia is the CEO of AdvenureWorks.',
      vectorContent: [ 0.51, 0.12, 0.23 ]
    }
  },
  {
    similarityScore: 0.9006955,
    document: {
      _id: ObjectId("645acb54413be5502badff97"),
      name: 'Rory Nguyen',
      bio: 'Rory Nguyen is the founder of AdventureWorks and the president of the Our Planet initiative.',
      vectorContent: [ 0.91, 0.76, 0.83 ]
    }
  }
]
```

---

### Get vector index definitions

To retrieve your vector index definition from the collection, use the `listIndexes` command:

``` javascript
db.exampleCollection.getIndexes();
```

In this example, `vectorIndex` is returned with all the `cosmosSearch` parameters that were used to create the index:

```javascript
[
  { v: 2, key: { _id: 1 }, name: '_id_', ns: 'test.exampleCollection' },
  {
    v: 2,
    key: { vectorContent: 'cosmosSearch' },
    name: 'vectorSearchIndex',
    cosmosSearch: {
      kind: <index_type>, // options are `vector-ivf`, `vector-hnsw`, and `vector-diskann`
      numLists: 3,
      similarity: 'COS',
      dimensions: 3
    },
    ns: 'test.exampleCollection'
  }
]
```

## Filtered vector search (preview)

You can now execute vector searches with any supported query filter such as `$lt`, `$lte`, `$eq`, `$neq`, `$gte`, `$gt`, `$in`, `$nin`, and `$regex`. Enable the "filtering vector search" feature in the "Preview Features" tab of your Azure Subscription. Learn more about preview features [here](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/preview-features).

First, you'll need to define an index for your filter in addition to a vector index. For example, you can define the filter index on a property  

```javascript
db.runCommand({ 
     "createIndexes": "<collection_name",
    "indexes": [ {
        "key": { 
            "<property_to_filter>": 1 
               }, 
        "name": "<name_of_filter_index>" 
    }
    ] 
});
```

Next, you can add the `"filter"` term to your vector search as shown below. In this example the filter is looking for documents where the `"title"` property is not in the list of `["not in this text", "or this text"]`.

```javascript

db.exampleCollection.aggregate([
  {
      '$search': {
          "cosmosSearch": {
              "vector": "<query_vector>",
              "path": <path_to_vector>,
              "k": num_results,
              "filter": {<property_to_filter>: {"$nin": ["not in this text", "or this text"]}}
          },
          "returnStoredSource": True }},
      {'$project': { 'similarityScore': { '$meta': 'searchScore' }, 'document' : '$$ROOT' }
}
]);
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While in preview, filtered vector search may require you to adjust your vector index parameters to achieve higher accuracy. For example, increasing `m`, `efConstruction`, or `efSearch` when using HNSW, or `numLists`, or `nProbes` when using IVF, may lead to better results. You should test your configuration before use to ensure that the results are satisfactory.
