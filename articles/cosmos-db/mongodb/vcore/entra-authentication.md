# Microsoft Entra ID authentication with Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore

Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore supports integration with Microsoft Entra ID and native DocumentDB authentication. Each Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore cluster is created with native DocumentDB authentication enabled and one built-in administrative user.

You can enable Microsoft Entra ID authentication on a cluster in addition to the native DocumentDB authentication method or instead of it. You can configure authentication methods on each Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore cluster independently. If you need to change authentication method, you can do it at any time after cluster provisioning is completed. Changing authentication methods doesn't require cluster restart.

## Microsoft Entra ID authentication

[Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/fundamentals/whatis) authentication is a mechanism of connecting to Azure Cosmos DB  for MongoDB vCore using identities defined in Microsoft Entra ID. With Microsoft Entra ID authentication, you can manage database user identities and other Microsoft services in a central location, which simplifies permission management and identity services compliance enforcement.

Benefits of using Microsoft Entra ID for authentication include:

- Authentication of users across Azure services in a uniform way

- Management of password policies and password rotation in a single place

- Multiple forms of authentication supported by Microsoft Entra ID, which can eliminate the need to store passwords

- Support of token-based authentication for applications connecting to Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore clusters

Interoperability with MongoDB drivers is provided via [OpenID Connect (OIDC) support in Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity-platform/v2-protocols-oidc). OIDC is an authentication protocol based on the OAuth2 protocol used for authorization. OIDC uses the standardized message flows from OAuth2 to provide identity services. When you need to authenticate to an Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore cluster via Microsoft Entra ID, provide a Microsoft Entra ID security token using OIDC identification.

### Administrative and nonadministrative access for Microsoft Entra ID principals

When Microsoft Entra ID authentication is enabled on an Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore cluster, you can add one or more Microsoft Entra ID principals as *administrator users* to that cluster. The Microsoft Entra ID administrator can be a Microsoft Entra ID user, a service principal, or a managed identity. Multiple Microsoft Entra ID administrators can be configured at any time. 

Administrative Entra ID users are created as Azure entities under Microsoft.DocumentDB/mongoClusters/users and are replicated to the database.

Additionally, one or more nonadministrative Microsoft Entra ID users can be added to a cluster at any time once Microsoft Entra ID authentication is enabled. Nonadministrative users are often used for ongoing production tasks that don't require administrative privileges.

## Considerations

- The cluster must have an authentication method enabled. It can be both native authentication and Microsoft Entra ID or one of those methods.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > When a cluster is created, you have to have the native DocumentDB authentication method enabled and specify native administrative user credentials. You can disable the native DocumentDB authentication method once new cluster finishes provisioning.  
    
- Authentication methods on the primary cluster and on the replica cluster are [managed independently](./cross-region-replication.md#authentication-methods-on-replica-cluster).

- Multiple Microsoft Entra ID principals can be configured as Microsoft Entra ID administrator for an Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore cluster at any time. For example, you can configure these types of identities to all be administrators in your cluster simultaneously:

    - Human identities
    - User-assigned managed identities
    - System-assigned managed identities

    > [!TIP]
    > There are many other types of identities available in Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, see [identity fundamentals](/entra/fundamentals/identity-fundamental-concepts#identity).

- Microsoft Entra ID principals are persistent. If a Microsoft Entra ID principal is deleted from Microsoft Entra ID service, it still remains as a user on the cluster, but it's no longer able to acquire new access token. In this case, although the matching role still exists on the cluster, it's unable to authenticate to the cluster nodes. Database administrators need to transfer ownership and drop such roles manually.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Sign in with a deleted principal can still occur until the token expires (up to 90 minutes *from the issuing of the token*). If you also remove the user from the Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore cluster, this access is revoked *immediately*.
