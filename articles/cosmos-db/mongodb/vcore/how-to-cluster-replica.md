# Manage cross-region and same region replication on your Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore cluster

Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore allows continuous data streaming to a replica cluster in another or the same Azure region. That capability provides cross-region disaster recovery (DR) protection and read scalability across the regions and in the same region. This document serves as a quick guide for developers who want to learn how to manage replication for their clusters.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE[Prerequisite - Azure subscription](includes/prereq-azure-subscription.md)]

## Enable cross-region or same region replication

You can create a replica cluster during new cluster provisioning or at any time on an existing cluster.

### Replica cluster creation during new cluster provisioning

To enable replication on a new cluster *during cluster creation*, follow these steps:

1. Follow the steps to [start cluster creation and complete the **Basics** tab for a new Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore cluster](./quickstart-portal.md#create-a-cluster).
1. (optionally) Select desired network access settings for the cluster on the **Networking** tab.
1. On the **Global distribution** tab, select **Enable** for the **Cluster replica**.
1. Provide a replica cluster name in the **Read replica name** field. 
1. Select a region in the **Read replica region**. The replica cluster is hosted in the selected Azure region.
1. On the **Review + create** tab, review cluster configuration details, and then select **Create**. 

> [!NOTE]
> The replica cluster is created in the same Azure subscription and resource group as its primary cluster.

### Replica cluster creation for existing cluster

To enable replication on a new cluster *at any time after cluster creation*, follow these steps:

1. Follow the steps to [create a new Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore cluster](./quickstart-portal.md#create-a-cluster).
1. Skip **Global distribution** tab. This tab is used to create a cluster replica during primary cluster provisioning.
1. *Once cluster is created*, on the cluster sidebar, under **Settings**, select **Global distribution**.
1. Select **Add new read replica**.
1. Provide a replica cluster name in the **Read replica name** field. 
1. Select a region in the **Read replica region**. The replica cluster is hosted in the selected Azure region.
1. (optionally) Select **Customer-manageed key** in **Data encryption** section to enable data encryption with a customer-managed key (CMK) on replica cluster. Then follow [the steps to enable CMK](./how-to-data-encryption.md#change-data-encryption-mode-on-existing-clusters).
1. Verify your selection and select the **Save** button to confirm replica creation.

To make the replica cluster accessible for read operations, adjust its networking settings by configuring firewall rules for public access or by adding private endpoints for secure, private access.

## Promote a replica

To [promote a cluster replica](./cross-region-replication.md#replica-cluster-promotion) to a read-write cluster, follow these steps:

1. Select the cluster replica you would like to promote in the portal.
1. On the cluster sidebar, under **Settings**, select **Global distribution**.
1. On the **Global distribution** page, select **Promote**.
1. On the **Promote \<cluster name>** screen, double check the cluster replica's name, read the warning text, and select **Promote**.

After the cluster replica is promoted, it becomes a readable and writable cluster. If [high availability (HA)](./high-availability.md) is enabled on the primary (read-write) cluster, it needs to be re-enabled on the replica cluster after promotion.

## Check cluster replication role and replication region

To check replication role of a cluster, follow these steps:
1. Select an existing Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore cluster.
1. Select **Overview** page.
1. Check **Read region** (on the primary cluster) or **Write region** (on the replica cluster) value.

If **Read region** value is *Not enabled*, this cluster has replication disabled.

## Disable cross-region or same region replication

To disable replication, follow these steps:

1. Select the Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore *replica* cluster.
1. Select **Overview**.
1. [Confirm that it's a replica cluster](#check-cluster-replication-role-and-replication-region).
1. In the Azure portal, on the **Overview** page for the replica cluster, select **Delete**.
1. On the **Delete \<replica name>** screen, read the warning text, and enter cluster's name in the **Confirm the account name** field.
1. Select **Delete** to confirm deletion of the replica.

If you need to delete the primary and replica clusters, you would need to delete the replica cluster first.

## Use connection strings

You can connect to the cluster replica as you would to a regular read-write cluster. 
Follow these steps to [get the connection strings for different cases](./cross-region-replication.md#continuous-writes-read-operations-on-cluster-replicas-and-connection-strings):

1. Select the primary cluster or its cluster replica in the portal.
1. On the cluster sidebar, under **Settings**, select **Connection strings**.
1. Copy the self connection string for currently selected cluster to connect to that cluster.
1. (optionally, on the primary cluster only) Copy the global read-write connection string that always points to the cluster available for writes.

Self connection strings are preserved after [the cluster replica promotion](./cross-region-replication.md#replica-cluster-promotion). You can continue to use either string or global read-write connection string for read operations. If you use self connection string for write operations, you need to update connection string in your application to point to the promoted replica cluster to continue writes to the database after promotion is completed.
