## Common errors and solutions

### Unable to Connect to Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore - Timeout error 
This issue might occur when the cluster does not have the correct firewall rule(s) enabled. If you're trying to access the cluster from a non-Azure IP range, you need to add extra firewall rules. Refer to [Security options and features - Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore](./security.md#network-security-options) for detailed steps. Firewall rules can be configured in the portal's Networking setting for the cluster. Options include adding a known IP address/range or enabling public IP access.

### Unable to Connect with DNSClient.DnsResponseException Error
#### Debugging Connectivity Issues: 
Windows User: <br>
Psping doesn't work. The use of nslookup confirms cluster reachability and discoverability, indicating network issues are unlikely.

Unix Users: <br>
For Socket/Network-related exceptions, potential network connectivity issues might be hindering the application from establishing a connection with the Azure Cosmos DB Mongo API endpoint.

To check connectivity, follow these steps:
```
nc -v <accountName>.mongocluster.cosmos.azure.com 10260
```
If TCP connect to port 10260 fails, an environment firewall may be blocking the Azure Cosmos DB connection. Kindly scroll down to the page's bottom to submit a support ticket.



#### Verify your connection string: 
Only use the connection string provided in the Azure portal. Ensure that it includes the mongodb+srv:// protocol, as this is required for proper connectivity. Avoid using any variations or prefixes like c.. If you encounter issues with connectivity, share the application or client-side driver logs for debugging by submitting a support ticket.
