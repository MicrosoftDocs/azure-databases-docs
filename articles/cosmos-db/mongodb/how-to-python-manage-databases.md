# Manage a MongoDB database using Python

[!INCLUDE[MongoDB](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/cosmos-db/includes/appliesto-mongodb.md)]

Your MongoDB server in Azure Cosmos DB is available from the common Python packages for MongoDB such as:

* [PyMongo](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/pymongo/) for synchronous Python applications and used in this article.
* [Motor](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/motor/) for asynchronous Python applications.

> [!NOTE]
> The [example code snippets](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cosmos-db-mongodb-python-getting-started) are available on GitHub as a Python project.

## Name a database

In Azure Cosmos DB, a database is analogous to a namespace. When you create a database, the database name forms a segment of the URI used to access the database resource and any child resources.

Here are some quick rules when naming a database:

Once created, the URI for a database is in this format:

`https://<cosmos-account-name>.documents.azure.com/dbs/<database-name>`

## Get database instance

The database holds the collections and their documents. To access a database, use attribute style access or dictionary style access of the MongoClient. For more information, see [Getting a Database](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html#getting-a-database).

The following code snippets assume you've already created your [client connection](how-to-python-get-started.md#create-mongoclient-with-connection-string) and that you [close your client connection](how-to-python-get-started.md#close-the-mongoclient-connection) after these code snippets.

## Get server information

Access server info with the [server_info](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/pymongo/mongo_client.html#pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient.server_info) method of the MongoClient class. You don't need to specify the database name to get this information. The information returned is specific to MongoDB and doesn't represent the Azure Cosmos DB platform itself.

You can also list databases using the [MongoClient.list_database_names](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/pymongo/mongo_client.html#pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient.list_database_names) method and issue a [MongoDB command](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/nav-diagnostic/) to a database with the [MongoClient.db.command](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/pymongo/database.html#pymongo.database.Database.command) method.

The preceding code snippet displays output similar to the following example console output:

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-cosmos-db-mongodb-python-getting-started/200-admin/run.py" id="console_result":::

## Does database exist?

The PyMongo driver for Python creates a database if it doesn't exist when you access it. However, we recommend that instead you use the [MongoDB extension commands](./custom-commands.md) to manage data stored in Azure Cosmos DB’s API for MongoDB. To create a new database if it doesn't exist, use the [create database extension](./custom-commands.md#create-database) as shown in the following code snippet.

To see if the database already exists before using it, get the list of current databases with the [list_database_names](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/pymongo/mongo_client.html#pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient.list_database_names) method.

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-cosmos-db-mongodb-python-getting-started/201-does-database-exist/run.py" id="does_database_exist":::

The preceding code snippet displays output similar to the following example console output:

:::code language="console" source="~/azure-cosmos-db-mongodb-python-getting-started/201-does-database-exist/run.py" id="console_result":::

## Get list of databases, collections, and document count

When you manage your MongoDB server programmatically, it's helpful to know what databases and collections are on the server and how many documents in each collection. For more information, see:

* [Getting a database](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html#getting-a-database)
* [Getting a collection](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html#getting-a-collection)
* [Counting documents](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html#counting)

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-cosmos-db-mongodb-python-getting-started/202-get-doc-count/run.py" id="database_object":::

The preceding code snippet displays output similar to the following example console output:

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-cosmos-db-mongodb-python-getting-started/202-get-doc-count/run.py" id="console_result":::

## Get database object instance

If a database doesn't exist, the PyMongo driver for Python creates it when you access it. However, we recommend that instead you use the [MongoDB extension commands](./custom-commands.md) to manage data stored in Azure Cosmos DB’s API for MongoDB. The pattern is shown above in the section [Does database exist?](#does-database-exist).

When working with PyMongo, you access databases using attribute style access on MongoClient instances. Once you have a database instance, you can use database level operations as shown below.

```python
collections = client[db].list_collection_names()
```

For an overview of working with databases using the PyMongo driver, see [Database level operations](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/pymongo/database.html#pymongo.database.Database).


## Drop a database

A database is removed from the server using the [drop_database](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/pymongo/mongo_client.html#pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient.drop_database) method of the MongoClient.

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-cosmos-db-mongodb-python-getting-started/300-drop-database/run.py" id="drop_database":::

The preceding code snippet displays output similar to the following example console output:

:::code language="console" source="~/azure-cosmos-db-mongodb-python-getting-started/300-drop-database/run.py" id="console_result":::
