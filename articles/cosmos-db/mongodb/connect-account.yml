  Connect a MongoDB application to Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB
introduction: |
  Learn how to connect your MongoDB app to an Azure Cosmos DB by using a MongoDB connection string. You can then use an Azure Cosmos DB database as the data store for your MongoDB app.

  This tutorial provides two ways to retrieve connection string information:

  * [The quickstart method](#get-the-mongodb-connection-string-by-using-the-quick-start), for use with .NET, Node.js, MongoDB Shell, Java, and Python drivers.
  * [The custom connection string method](#get-the-mongodb-connection-string-to-customize), for use with other drivers.

    There are two items required
  dependencies:
    - |
      An Azure account. If you don't have an Azure account, create a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn) now.
    - |
      An Azure Cosmos DB account. For instructions, see [Quickstart: Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB driver for Node.js](create-mongodb-dotnet.md).

    summary: |
      Follow the below steps:
    steps:
      - |
        In an Internet browser, sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
      - |
        In the **Azure Cosmos DB** pane, select the API.
      - |
        In the left pane of the account pane, select **Quick start**.
      - |
        Choose your platform (**.NET**, **Node.js**, **MongoDB Shell**, **Java**, **Python**). If you don't see your driver or tool listed, don't worry--we continuously document more connection code snippets. Comment on what you'd like to see. To learn how to craft your own connection, read [Get the account's connection string information](#get-the-mongodb-connection-string-to-customize).
      - |
        Copy and paste the code snippet into your MongoDB app.

      - |
        In an Internet browser, sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
      - |
        In the **Azure Cosmos DB** pane, select the API.
      - |
        In the left pane of the account pane, select **Connection strings**.
      - |
        The **Connection strings** pane opens. It has all the information necessary to connect to the account by using a driver for MongoDB, including a preconstructed connection string.
        
        ### Connection string requirements

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > Azure Cosmos DB has strict security requirements and standards. Azure Cosmos DB accounts require authentication and secure communication via *TLS*.

        Azure Cosmos DB supports the standard MongoDB connection string URI format, with a couple of specific requirements: Azure Cosmos DB accounts require authentication and secure communication via TLS. The connection string format is:

        `mongodb://username:password@host:port/[database]?ssl=true`

        The values of this string are:

        - Username (required): Azure Cosmos DB account name.
        - Password (required): Azure Cosmos DB account password.
        - Host (required): FQDN of the Azure Cosmos DB account.
        - Port (required): 10255.
        - Database (optional): The database that the connection uses. If no database is provided, the default database is "test."
        - ssl=true (required).

        For example, consider the account shown in the **Connection strings** pane. A valid connection string is:

        `mongodb://contoso123:0Fc3IolnL12312asdfawejunASDF@asdfYXX2t8a97kghVcUzcDv98hawelufhawefafnoQRGwNj2nMPL1Y9qsIr9Srdw==@contoso123.documents.azure.com:10255/mydatabase?ssl=true`
  
        ### Driver requirements

        All drivers that support wire protocol version 3.4 or greater support Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB.

        - Client drivers must support the Service Name Identification (SNI) TLS extension and/or the appName connection string option. 
        - If the `appName` parameter is provided, it must be included as found in the connection string value in the Azure portal.
