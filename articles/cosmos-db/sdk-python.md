## Release history and retirement dates

Release history is maintained in the azure-sdk-for-python repo, for detailed list of releases, see the [changelog file](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/cosmos/azure-cosmos/CHANGELOG.md).

Microsoft provides notification at least **12 months** in advance of retiring an SDK in order to smooth the transition to a newer/supported version. New features and functionality and optimizations are only added to the current SDK, as such it is recommended that you always upgrade to the latest SDK version as early as possible.

> [!WARNING]
> After 31 August 2022, Azure Cosmos DB will no longer make bug fixes or provide support to versions 1.x and 2.x of the Azure Cosmos DB Python SDK for API for NoSQL. If you prefer not to upgrade, requests sent from version 1.x and 2.x of the SDK will continue to be served by the Azure Cosmos DB service.
