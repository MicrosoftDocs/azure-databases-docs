# Apache Cassandra and Azure Cosmos DB for Apache Cassandra consistency levels

[!INCLUDE[Cassandra](../includes/appliesto-cassandra.md)]

Unlike Azure Cosmos DB, Apache Cassandra doesn't natively provide precisely defined consistency guarantees. Instead, Apache Cassandra provides a write consistency level and a read consistency level, to enable the high availability, consistency, and latency tradeoffs. When using Azure Cosmos DB for Cassandra:

- The write consistency level of Apache Cassandra is mapped to the default consistency level configured on your Azure Cosmos DB account. Consistency for a write operation (CL) can't be changed on a per-request basis.
- Azure Cosmos DB will dynamically map the read consistency level specified by the Cassandra client driver. The consistency level will be mapped to one of the Azure Cosmos DB consistency levels configured dynamically on a read request.

## Multi-region writes vs single-region writes

Apache Cassandra database is a multi-master system by default, and doesn't provide an out-of-box option for single-region writes with multi-region replication for reads. However, Azure Cosmos DB provides turnkey ability to have either single region, or [multi-region](../how-to-multi-master.md) write configurations. One of the advantages of being able to choose a single region write configuration across multiple regions is the avoidance of cross-region conflict scenarios, and the option of maintaining strong consistency across multiple regions.

With single-region writes, you can maintain strong consistency, while still maintaining a level of high availability across regions with [service-managed failover](../high-availability.md#region-outages). In this configuration, you can still exploit data locality to reduce read latency by downgrading to eventual consistency on a per request basis. In addition to these capabilities, the Azure Cosmos DB platform also offers the option of [zone redundancy](/azure/architecture/reliability/architect) when selecting a region. Thus, unlike native Apache Cassandra, Azure Cosmos DB allows you to navigate the CAP Theorem [trade-off spectrum](../consistency-levels.md#consistency-levels-and-data-durability) with more granularity.

## Mapping consistency levels

The Azure Cosmos DB platform provides a set of five well-defined, business use-case oriented consistency settings with respect to replication. The tradeoffs to these consistency settings are defined by the [CAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem) and [PACLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PACELC_theorem) theorems. As this approach differs significantly from Apache Cassandra, we would recommend that you take time to review and understand [Azure Cosmos DB consistency](../consistency-levels.md). Alternatively, you can review this short [video guide to understanding consistency settings](https://aka.ms/docs.consistency-levels) in the Azure Cosmos DB platform. The following table illustrates the possible mappings between Apache Cassandra and Azure Cosmos DB consistency levels when using API for Cassandra. This table shows configurations for single region, multi-region reads with single-region writes, and multi-region writes.

### Mappings

> [!NOTE]
> These are not exact mappings. Rather, we have provided the closest analogues to Apache Cassandra, and disambiguated any qualitative differences in the rightmost column. As mentioned above, we recommend reviewing Azure Cosmos DB's [consistency settings](../consistency-levels.md).

### `ALL`, `EACH_QUOROM`, `QUOROM`, `LOCAL_QUORUM`, or `THREE` write consistency in Apache Cassandra

| Apache read consistency | Reading from | Closest Azure Cosmos DB consistency level to Apache Cassandra read/write settings |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ALL` | Local region | `Strong` |
| `EACH_QUOROM` | Local region | `Strong` |
| `QUOROM` | Local region | `Strong` |
| `LOCAL_QUORUM` | Local region | `Strong` |
| `LOCAL_ONE` | Local region | `Eventual` |
| `ONE` | Local region | `Eventual` |
| `TWO` | Local region | `Strong` |
| `THREE` | Local region | `Strong` |

Unlike Apache and DSE Cassandra, Azure Cosmos DB durably commits a quorum write by default. At least three out of four (3/4) nodes commit the write to disk, and NOT just an in-memory commit log.

### `ONE`, `LOCAL_ONE`, or `ANY` write consistency in Apache Cassandra

| Apache read consistency | Reading from | Closest Azure Cosmos DB consistency level to Apache Cassandra read/write settings |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ALL` | Local region | `Strong` |
| `EACH_QUOROM` | Local region | `Eventual` |
| `QUOROM` | Local region | `Eventual` |
| `LOCAL_QUORUM` | Local region | `Eventual` |
| `LOCAL_ONE` | Local region | `Eventual` |
| `ONE` | Local region | `Eventual` |
| `TWO` | Local region | `Eventual` |
| `THREE` | Local region | `Eventual` |

Azure Cosmos DB API for Cassandra always durably commits a quorum write by default, hence all read consistencies can be made use of.

### `TWO` write consistency in Apache Cassandra

| Apache read consistency | Reading from | Closest Azure Cosmos DB consistency level to Apache Cassandra read/write settings |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ALL` | Local region | `Strong` |
| `EACH_QUOROM` | Local region | `Strong` |
| `QUOROM` | Local region | `Strong` |
| `LOCAL_QUORUM` | Local region | `Strong` |
| `LOCAL_ONE` | Local region | `Eventual` |
| `ONE` | Local region | `Eventual` |
| `TWO` | Local region | `Eventual` |
| `THREE` | Local region | `Strong` |

Azure Cosmos DB has no notion of write consistency to only two nodes, hence we treat this consistency similar to quorum for most cases. For read consistency `TWO`, this consistency is equivalent to write with `QUOROM` and read from `ONE`.

### `Serial`, or `Local_Serial` write consistency in Apache Cassandra

| Apache read consistency | Reading from | Closest Azure Cosmos DB consistency level to Apache Cassandra read/write settings |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ALL` | Local region | `Strong` |
| `EACH_QUOROM` | Local region | `Strong` |
| `QUOROM` | Local region | `Strong` |
| `LOCAL_QUORUM` | Local region | `Strong` |
| `LOCAL_ONE` | Local region | `Eventual` |
| `ONE` | Local region | `Eventual` |
| `TWO` | Local region | `Strong` |
| `THREE` | Local region | `Strong` |

Serial only applies to lightweight transactions. Azure Cosmos DB follows a [durably committed algorithm](https://www.microsoft.com/research/publication/revisiting-paxos-algorithm/) by default, and hence `Serial` consistency is similar to quorum.

### Other regions for single-region write

Azure Cosmos DB facilitates five consistency settings, including strong, across multiple regions where single-region writes is configured. This facilitation occurs as long as regions are within 2,000 miles of each other.

Azure Cosmos DB doesn't have an applicable mapping to Apache Cassandra as all nodes/regions are writes and a strong consistency guarantee isn't possible across all regions.

### Other regions for multi-region write

Azure Cosmos DB facilitates only four consistency settings; `eventual`, `consistent prefix`, `session`, and `bounded staleness` across multiple regions where multi-region write is configured.

Apache Cassandra would only provide eventual consistency for reads across other regions regardless of settings.

### Dynamic overrides supported

| Azure Cosmos DB account setting | Override value in client request | Override effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Strong` | `All` | No effect (remain as `strong`) |
| `Strong` | `Quorum` | No effect (remain as `strong`) |
| `Strong` | `LocalQuorum` | No effect (remain as `strong`) |
| `Strong` | `Two` | No effect (remain as `strong`) |
| `Strong` | `Three` | No effect (remain as `strong`) |
| `Strong` | `Serial` | No effect (remain as `strong`) |
| `Strong` | `LocalSerial` | No effect (remain as `strong`) |
| `Strong` | `One` | Consistency changes to `Eventual` |
| `Strong` | `LocalOne` | Consistency changes to `Eventual` |
| `Strong` | `Any` | Not allowed (error) |
| `Strong` | `EachQuorum` | Not allowed (error) |
| `Bounded staleness`, `session`, or `consistent prefix` | `All` | Not allowed (error) |
| `Bounded staleness`, `session`, or `consistent prefix` | `Quorum` | Not allowed (error) |
| `Bounded staleness`, `session`, or `consistent prefix` | `LocalQuorum` | Not allowed (error) |
| `Bounded staleness`, `session`, or `consistent prefix` | `Two` | Not allowed (error) |
| `Bounded staleness`, `session`, or `consistent prefix` | `Three` | Not allowed (error) |
| `Bounded staleness`, `session`, or `consistent prefix` | `Serial` | Not allowed (error) |
| `Bounded staleness`, `session`, or `consistent prefix` | `LocalSerial` | Not allowed (error) |
| `Bounded staleness`, `session`, or `consistent prefix` | `One` | Consistency changes to `Eventual` |
| `Bounded staleness`, `session`, or `consistent prefix` | `LocalOne` | Consistency changes to `Eventual` |
| `Bounded staleness`, `session`, or `consistent prefix` | `Any` | Not allowed (error) |
| `Bounded staleness`, `session`, or `consistent prefix` | `EachQuorum` | Not allowed (error) |

### Metrics

If your Azure Cosmos DB account is configured with a consistency level other than the strong consistency, review the *Probabilistically Bounded Staleness (PBS)* metric. The metric captures the probability that your clients may get strong and consistent reads for your workloads. This metric is exposed in the Azure portal. To find more information about the PBS metric, see [Monitor Probabilistically Bounded Staleness (PBS) metric](../how-to-manage-consistency.md#monitor-probabilistically-bounded-staleness-pbs-metric).

Probabilistically bounded staleness shows how eventual is your eventual consistency. This metric provides an insight into how often you can get a stronger consistency than the consistency level that you've currently configured on your Azure Cosmos DB account. In other words, you can see the probability (measured in milliseconds) of getting consistent reads for a combination of write and read regions.

## Global strong consistency for write requests in Apache Cassandra

Apache Cassandra, the setting of `EACH_QUORUM` or `QUORUM` gives a strong consistency. When a write request is sent to a region, `EACH_QUORUM` persists the data in a quorum number of nodes in each data center. This persistence requires every data center to be available for the write operation to succeed. `QUORUM` is slightly less restrictive, with a `QUORUM` number of nodes across all the data centers needed to persist the data prior to acknowledging the write to be successful.

The following graphic illustrates a global strong consistency setting in Apache Cassandra between two regions 1 and 2. After data is written to region 1, the write needs to be persisted in a quorum number of nodes in both region 1, and region 2 before an acknowledgment is received by the application.

## Global strong consistency for write requests in Azure Cosmos DB for Apache Cassandra

In Azure Cosmos DB consistency is set at the account level. With `Strong` consistency in Azure Cosmos DB for Cassandra, data is replicated synchronously to the read regions for the account. The further apart the regions for the Azure Cosmos DB account are, the higher the latency of the consistent write operations.

:::image type="content" source="./media/consistency-mapping/write-global-consistency-ours.svg" alt-text="Diagram of global write consistency in Azure Cosmos DB for Apache Cassandra.":::

How the number of regions affects your read or write request:

- Two regions: With strong consistency, quorum `(N/2 + 1) = 2`. So, if the read region goes down, the account can no longer accept writes with strong consistency since a quorum number of regions isn't available for the write to be replicated to.
- Three or more regions: for `N = 3`, `quorum = 2`. If one of the read regions is down, the write region can still replicate the writes to a total of two regions that meet the quorum requirement. Similarly, with four regions, `quorum = 4/2 + 1 = 3`.  Even with one read region being down, quorum can be met.

> [!NOTE]
> If a globally strong consistency is required for all write operations, the consistency for Azure Cosmos DB for Cassandra account must be set to Strong. The consistency level for write operations cannot be overridden to a lower consistency level on a per request basis in Azure Cosmos DB.

## Weaker consistency for write requests in Apache Cassandra

A consistency level of `ANY`, `ONE`, `TWO`, `THREE`, `LOCAL_QUORUM`, `Serial` or `Local_Serial`? Consider a write request with `LOCAL_QUORUM` with an `RF` of `4` in a six-node datacenter. `Quorum = 4/2 + 1 = 3`.

:::image type="content" source="./media/consistency-mapping/write-not-global-consistency-theirs.svg" alt-text="Diagram of non-global write consistency in Apache Cassandra.":::

## Weaker consistency for write requests in Azure Cosmos DB for Apache Cassandra

When a write request is sent with any of the consistency levels lower than `Strong`, a success response is returned as soon as the local region persists the write in at least three out of four replicas.

:::image type="content" source="./media/consistency-mapping/write-not-global-consistency-ours.svg" alt-text="Diagram of non-global write consistency in Azure Cosmos DB for Apache Cassandra.":::

## Global strong consistency for read requests in Apache Cassandra

With a consistency of `EACH_QUORUM`, a consistent read can be achieved in Apache Cassandra. In, a multi-region setup for `EACH_QUORUM` if the quorum number of nodes isn't met in each region, then the read will be unsuccessful.

:::image type="content" source="./media/consistency-mapping/read-global-consistency-theirs.svg" alt-text="Diagram of  global read consistency in Apache Cassandra.":::

## Global strong consistency for read requests in Azure Cosmos DB for Apache Cassandra

The read request is served from two replicas in the specified region. Since the write already took care of persisting to a quorum number of regions (and all regions if every region was available), simply reading from two replicas in the specified region provides Strong consistency.  This strong consistency requires `EACH_QUORUM` to be specified in the driver when issuing the read against a region for the Cosmos DB account along with Strong Consistency as the default consistency level for the account.

:::image type="content" source="./media/consistency-mapping/read-global-consistency-ours.svg" alt-text="Diagram of  global read consistency in Azure Cosmos DB for Apache Cassandra.":::

## Local strong consistency in Apache Cassandra

A read   request with a consistency level of `TWO`, `THREE`, or `LOCAL_QUORUM` will give us strong consistency reading from local region. With a consistency level of `LOCAL_QUORUM`, you need a response from two nodes in the specified datacenter for a successful read.

:::image type="content" source="./media/consistency-mapping/read-local-strong-consistency-theirs.svg" alt-text="Diagram of local strong read consistency in Apache Cassandra.":::

## Local strong consistency in Azure Cosmos DB for Apache Cassandra

In Azure Cosmos DB for Cassandra, having a consistency level of `TWO`, `THREE` or `LOCAL_QUORUM` will give a local strong consistency for a read request. Since the write path guarantees replicating to a minimum of three out of four replicas, a read from two replicas in the specified region will guarantee a quorum read of the data in that region.

:::image type="content" source="./media/consistency-mapping/read-local-strong-consistency-ours.svg" alt-text="Diagram of local strong read consistency in Azure Cosmos DB for Apache Cassandra.":::

## Eventual consistency in Apache Cassandra

A consistency level of `LOCAL_ONE`, `One` and `ANY with LOCAL_ONE` will result in eventual consistency. This consistency is used in cases where the focus is on latency.

:::image type="content" source="./media/consistency-mapping/read-eventual-consistency-theirs.svg" alt-text="Diagram of eventual read consistency in Apache Cassandra.":::

## Eventual consistency in Azure Cosmos DB for Apache Cassandra?

A consistency level of `LOCAL_ONE`, `ONE` or `Any` will give you eventual consistency. With eventual consistency, a read is served from just one of the replicas in the specified region.

:::image type="content" source="./media/consistency-mapping/read-eventual-consistency-ours.svg" alt-text="Diagram of eventual read consistency in Azure Cosmos DB for Apache Cassandra.":::

## Override consistency level for read operations in Azure Cosmos DB for Cassandra

Previously, the consistency level for read requests could only be overridden to a lower consistency than the default set on the account. For instance, with the default consistency of Strong, read requests could be issued with Strong by default and overridden on a per request basis (if needed) to a consistency level weaker than Strong. However, read requests couldn't be issued with an overridden consistency level higher than the account’s default. An account with Eventual consistency couldn't receive read requests with a consistency level higher than Eventual (which in the Apache Cassandra drivers translate to `TWO`, `THREE`, `LOCAL_QUORUM` or `QUORUM`).

Azure Cosmos DB for Cassandra now facilitates overriding the consistency on read requests to a value higher than the account’s default consistency. For instance, with the default consistency on the Cosmos DB account set to Eventual (Apache Cassandra equivalent of `One` or `ANY`), read requests can be overridden on a per request basis to `LOCAL_QUORUM`. This override ensures that a quorum number of replicas within the specified region are consulted prior to returning the result set, as required by `LOCAL_QUORUM`.

This option also prevents the need to set a default consistency that is higher than `Eventual`, when it's only needed for read requests.
