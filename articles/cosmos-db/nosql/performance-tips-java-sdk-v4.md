> The performance tips in this article are for Azure Cosmos DB Java SDK v4 only. Please view the Azure Cosmos DB Java SDK v4 [Release notes](sdk-java-v4.md), [Maven repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.azure/azure-cosmos), and Azure Cosmos DB Java SDK v4 [troubleshooting guide](troubleshoot-java-sdk-v4.md) for more information. If you are currently using an older version than v4, see the [Migrate to Azure Cosmos DB Java SDK v4](migrate-java-v4-sdk.md) guide for help with upgrading to v4.

Azure Cosmos DB is a fast and flexible distributed database that scales seamlessly with guaranteed latency and throughput. You don't have to make major architecture changes or write complex code to scale your database with Azure Cosmos DB. Scaling up and down is as easy as making a single API call or SDK method call. However, because Azure Cosmos DB is accessed via network calls there are client-side optimizations you can make to achieve peak performance when using Azure Cosmos DB Java SDK v4.

So if you're asking "How can I improve my database performance?" consider the following options:

## Networking
<a name="collocate-clients"></a>
**Collocate clients in same Azure region for performance**
<a id="same-region"></a>

When possible, place any applications calling Azure Cosmos DB in the same region as the Azure Cosmos DB database. For an approximate comparison, calls to Azure Cosmos DB within the same region complete within 1-2 ms, but the latency between the West and East coast of the US is >50 ms. This latency can likely vary from request to request depending on the route taken by the request as it passes from the client to the Azure datacenter boundary. The lowest possible latency is achieved by ensuring the calling application is located within the same Azure region as the provisioned Azure Cosmos DB endpoint. For a list of available regions, see [Azure Regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/#services).

:::image type="content" source="./media/performance-tips/same-region.png" alt-text="Illustration of the Azure Cosmos DB connection policy" border="false":::

An app that interacts with a multi-region Azure Cosmos DB account needs to configure 
[preferred locations](tutorial-global-distribution.md#preferred-locations) to ensure that requests are going to a collocated region.

**Enable accelerated networking to reduce latency and CPU jitter**

We strongly recommend following the instructions to enable [Accelerated Networking](/azure/virtual-network/accelerated-networking-overview) in your [Windows (select for instructions)](/azure/virtual-network/create-vm-accelerated-networking-powershell) or [Linux (select for instructions)](/azure/virtual-network/create-vm-accelerated-networking-cli) Azure VM to maximize the performance by reducing latency and CPU jitter.

Without accelerated networking, IO that transits between your Azure VM and other Azure resources might be routed through a host and virtual switch situated between the VM and its network card. Having the host and virtual switch inline in the datapath not only increases latency and jitter in the communication channel, it also steals CPU cycles from the VM. With accelerated networking, the VM interfaces directly with the NIC without intermediaries. All network policy details are handled in the hardware at the NIC, bypassing the host and virtual switch. Generally you can expect lower latency and higher throughput, as well as more *consistent* latency and decreased CPU utilization when you enable accelerated networking.

Limitations: accelerated networking must be supported on the VM OS, and can only be enabled when the VM is stopped and deallocated. The VM can't be deployed with Azure Resource Manager. [App Service](/azure/app-service/overview) has no accelerated network enabled.

For more information, see the [Windows](/azure/virtual-network/create-vm-accelerated-networking-powershell) and [Linux](/azure/virtual-network/create-vm-accelerated-networking-cli) instructions.

## High availability

For general guidance on configuring high availability in Azure Cosmos DB, see [High availability in Azure Cosmos DB](/azure/reliability/reliability-cosmos-db-nosql). 

In addition to a good foundational setup in the database platform, there are specific techniques that can be implemented in the Java SDK itself, which can help in outage scenarios. Two notable strategies are the threshold-based availability strategy and the partition-level circuit breaker.

These techniques provide advanced mechanisms to address specific latency and availability challenges, going above and beyond the cross-region retry capabilities that are built into the SDK by default. By proactively managing potential issues at the request and partition levels, these strategies can significantly enhance the resilience and performance of your application, particularly under high-load or degraded conditions.

### Threshold-based availability strategy

The threshold-based availability strategy can improve tail latency and availability by sending parallel read requests to secondary regions (as defined in `preferredRegions`) and accepting the fastest response. This approach can drastically reduce the impact of regional outages or high-latency conditions on application performance. Additionally, proactive connection management can be employed to further enhance performance by warming up connections and caches across both the current read region and preferred remote regions.

**Example configuration:**
```java
// Proactive Connection Management
CosmosContainerIdentity containerIdentity = new CosmosContainerIdentity("sample_db_id", "sample_container_id");
int proactiveConnectionRegionsCount = 2;
Duration aggressiveWarmupDuration = Duration.ofSeconds(1);

CosmosAsyncClient clientWithOpenConnections = new CosmosClientBuilder()
          .endpoint("<account URL goes here")
          .key("<account key goes here>")
          .endpointDiscoveryEnabled(true)
          .preferredRegions(Arrays.asList("East US", "East US 2", "West US"))
          .openConnectionsAndInitCaches(new CosmosContainerProactiveInitConfigBuilder(Arrays.asList(containerIdentity))
                .setProactiveConnectionRegionsCount(proactiveConnectionRegionsCount)
                 //setting aggressive warmup duration helps in cases where there is a high no. of partitions
                .setAggressiveWarmupDuration(aggressiveWarmupDuration)
                .build())
          .directMode()
          .buildAsyncClient();

CosmosAsyncContainer container = clientWithOpenConnections.getDatabase("sample_db_id").getContainer("sample_container_id");

int threshold = 500;
int thresholdStep = 100;

CosmosEndToEndOperationLatencyPolicyConfig config = new CosmosEndToEndOperationLatencyPolicyConfigBuilder(Duration.ofSeconds(3))
        .availabilityStrategy(new ThresholdBasedAvailabilityStrategy(Duration.ofMillis(threshold), Duration.ofMillis(thresholdStep)))
        .build();

CosmosItemRequestOptions options = new CosmosItemRequestOptions();
options.setCosmosEndToEndOperationLatencyPolicyConfig(config);

container.readItem("id", new PartitionKey("pk"), options, JsonNode.class).block();

// Write operations can benefit from threshold-based availability strategy if opted into non-idempotent write retry policy 
// and the account is configured for multi-region writes.
options.setNonIdempotentWriteRetryPolicy(true, true);
container.createItem("id", new PartitionKey("pk"), options, JsonNode.class).block();
```

**How it works:**

1. **Initial Request:** At time T1, a read request is made to the primary region (for example, East US). The SDK waits for a response for up to 500 milliseconds (the `threshold` value).
  
2. **Second Request:** If there's no response from the primary region within 500 milliseconds, a parallel request is sent to the next preferred region (for example, East US 2).
  
3. **Third Request:** If neither the primary nor the secondary region responds within 600 milliseconds (500ms + 100ms, the `thresholdStep` value), the SDK sends another parallel request to the third preferred region (for example, West US).

4. **Fastest Response Wins:** Whichever region responds first, that response is accepted, and the other parallel requests are ignored.

Proactive connection management helps by warming up connections and caches for containers across the preferred regions, reducing cold-start latency for failover scenarios or writes in multi-region setups.

This strategy can significantly improve latency in scenarios where a particular region is slow or temporarily unavailable, but it may incur more cost in terms of request units when parallel cross-region requests are required.

> [!NOTE]
> If the first preferred region returns a non-transient error status code (e.g., document not found, authorization error, conflict, etc.), the operation itself will fail fast, as availability strategy would not have any benefit in this scenario.

### Partition level circuit breaker

The partition-level circuit breaker enhances tail latency and write availability by tracking and short-circuiting requests to unhealthy physical partitions. It improves performance by avoiding known problematic partitions and redirecting requests to healthier regions.

**Example configuration:**

To enable partition-level circuit breaker:
```java
System.setProperty(
   "COSMOS.PARTITION_LEVEL_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_CONFIG",
      "{\"isPartitionLevelCircuitBreakerEnabled\": true, "
      + "\"circuitBreakerType\": \"CONSECUTIVE_EXCEPTION_COUNT_BASED\","
      + "\"consecutiveExceptionCountToleratedForReads\": 10,"
      + "\"consecutiveExceptionCountToleratedForWrites\": 5,"
      + "}");
```

To set the background process frequency for checking unavailable regions:
```java
System.setProperty("COSMOS.STALE_PARTITION_UNAVAILABILITY_REFRESH_INTERVAL_IN_SECONDS", "60");
```

To set the duration for which a partition can remain unavailable:
```java
System.setProperty("COSMOS.ALLOWED_PARTITION_UNAVAILABILITY_DURATION_IN_SECONDS", "30");
```

**How it works:**

1. **Tracking Failures:** The SDK tracks terminal failures (e.g., 503s, 500s, time-outs) for individual partitions in specific regions.
  
2. **Marking as Unavailable:** If a partition in a region exceeds a configured threshold of failures, it is marked as "Unavailable." Subsequent requests to this partition are short-circuited and redirected to other healthier regions.

3. **Automated Recovery:** A background thread periodically checks unavailable partitions. After a certain duration, these partitions are tentatively marked as "HealthyTentative" and subjected to test requests to validate recovery.

4. **Health Promotion/Demotion:** Based on the success or failure of these test requests, the status of the partition is either promoted back to "Healthy" or demoted once again to "Unavailable."

This mechanism helps to continuously monitor partition health and ensures that requests are served with minimal latency and maximum availability, without being bogged down by problematic partitions.

> [!NOTE]
> Circuit breaker only applies to multi-region write accounts, as when a partition is marked as `Unavailable`, both reads and writes are moved to the next preferred region. This is to prevent reads and writes from different regions being served from the same client instance, as this would be an anti-pattern.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must be using version 4.63.0 of the Java SDK or higher in order to activate Partition Level Circuit Breaker. 

### Comparing availability optimizations

- **Threshold-based availability strategy**: 
  - **Benefit**: Reduces tail latency by sending parallel read requests to secondary regions, and improves availability by preempting requests that will result in network time-outs.
  - **Trade-off**: Incurs extra RU (Request Units) costs compared to circuit breaker, due to additional parallel cross-region requests (though only during periods when thresholds are breached).
  - **Use Case**: Optimal for read-heavy workloads where reducing latency is critical and some additional cost (both in terms of RU charge and client CPU pressure) is acceptable. Write operations can also benefit, if opted into non-idempotent write retry policy and the account has multi-region writes.

- **Partition level circuit breaker**: 
  - **Benefit**: Improves availability and latency by avoiding unhealthy partitions, ensuring requests are routed to healthier regions.
  - **Trade-off**: Does not incur more RU costs, but can still allow some initial availability loss for requests that will result in network time-outs. 
  - **Use Case**: Ideal for write-heavy or mixed workloads where consistent performance is essential, especially when dealing with partitions that may intermittently become unhealthy.

Both strategies can be used together to enhance read and write availability and reduce tail latency. Partition Level Circuit Breaker can handle a variety of transient failure scenarios, including those that may result in slow performing replicas, without the need to perform parallel requests. Additionally, adding Threshold-based Availability Strategy will further minimize tail latency and eliminate availability loss, if additional RU cost is acceptable. 

By implementing these strategies, developers can ensure their applications remain resilient, maintain high performance, and provide a better user experience even during regional outages or high-latency conditions.

## Region scoped session consistency

### Overview
For more information about consistency settings in general, see [Consistency levels in Azure Cosmos DB](../consistency-levels.md). The Java SDK provides an optimization for [session consistency](../consistency-levels.md#session-consistency) for multi-region write accounts, by allowing it to be region-scoped. This enhances performance by mitigating cross-regional replication latency through minimizing client-side retries. This is achieved by managing session tokens at the region level instead of globally. If consistency in your application can be scoped to a smaller number of regions, by implementing region-scoped session consistency, you can achieve better performance and reliability for read and write operations in multi-write accounts by minimizing cross-regional replication delays and retries. 

### Benefits
- **Reduced Latency:** By localizing session token validation to the region level, the chances of costly cross-regional retries are reduced.
- **Enhanced Performance:** Minimizes the impact of regional failover and replication lag, offering higher read/write consistency and lower CPU utilization.
- **Optimized Resource Utilization:** Reduces CPU and network overhead on client applications by limiting the need for retries and cross-regional calls, thus optimizing resource usage.
- **High Availability:** By maintaining region-scoped session tokens, applications can continue to operate smoothly even if certain regions experience higher latency or temporary failures.
- **Consistency Guarantees:** Ensures that the session consistency (read your write, monotonic read) guarantees are met more reliably without unnecessary retries.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Reduces the number of cross-regional calls, thereby potentially lowering the costs associated with data transfers between regions.
- **Scalability:** Allows applications to scale more efficiently by reducing the contention and overhead associated with maintaining a global session token, especially in multi-region setups.

### Trade-Offs
- **Increased Memory Usage:** The bloom filter and region-specific session token storage require more memory, which may be a consideration for applications with limited resources.
- **Configuration Complexity:** Fine-tuning the expected insertion count and false-positive rate for the bloom filter adds a layer of complexity to the configuration process.
- **Potential for False Positives:** While the bloom filter minimizes cross-regional retries, there is still a slight chance of false positives impacting the session token validation, although the rate can be controlled. A false positive means the global session token is resolved, thereby increasing the chance of cross-regional retries if the local region has not caught up to this global session. Session guarantees are met even in the presence of false positives.
- **Applicability:** This feature is most beneficial for applications with a high cardinality of logical partitions and regular restarts. Applications with fewer logical partitions or infrequent restarts might not see significant benefits.


### How it works
#### Set the session token
1. **Request Completion:** After a request is completed, the SDK captures the session token and associates it with the region and partition key.
2. **Region-Level Storage:** Session tokens are stored in a nested `ConcurrentHashMap` that maintains mappings between partition key ranges and region-level progress.
3. **Bloom Filter:** A bloom filter keeps track of which regions have been accessed by each logical partition, helping to localize session token validation.

#### Resolve the session token
1. **Request Initialization:** Before a request is sent, the SDK attempts to resolve the session token for the appropriate region.
2. **Token Check:** The token is checked against the region-specific data to ensure the request is routed to the most up-to-date replica.
3. **Retry Logic:** If the session token is not validated within the current region, the SDK retries with other regions, but given the localized storage, this is less frequent.


### Use the SDK
 Here's how to initialize the CosmosClient with region-scoped session consistency:

```java
CosmosClient client = new CosmosClientBuilder()
    .endpoint("<your-endpoint>")
    .key("<your-key>")
    .consistencyLevel(ConsistencyLevel.SESSION)
    .buildClient();

// Your operations here
```

### Enable region-scoped session consistency
To enable region-scoped session capturing in your application, set the following system property:

```java
System.setProperty("COSMOS.SESSION_CAPTURING_TYPE", "REGION_SCOPED");
```

### Configure bloom filter
Fine-tune the performance by configuring the expected insertions and false positive rate for the bloom filter:

```java
System.setProperty("COSMOS.PK_BASED_BLOOM_FILTER_EXPECTED_INSERTION_COUNT", "5000000"); // adjust as needed
System.setProperty("COSMOS.PK_BASED_BLOOM_FILTER_EXPECTED_FFP_RATE", "0.001"); // adjust as needed
System.setProperty("COSMOS.SESSION_CAPTURING_TYPE", "REGION_SCOPED");
System.setProperty("COSMOS.PK_BASED_BLOOM_FILTER_EXPECTED_INSERTION_COUNT", "1000000");
System.setProperty("COSMOS.PK_BASED_BLOOM_FILTER_EXPECTED_FFP_RATE", "0.01");
```

### Memory implications
Below is the retained size (size of the object and whatever it depends on) of the internal session container (managed by the SDK) with varying expected insertions into the bloom filter.

|Expected Insertions|False Positive Rate|Retained Size|
|-----|------|--|
|10, 000|0.001|21 KB|
|100, 000|0.001|183 KB|
|1 million|0.001|1.8 MB|
|10 million|0.001|17.9 MB|
|100 million|0.001|179 MB|
|1 billion|0.001|1.8 GB|

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must be using version 4.60.0 of the Java SDK or higher in order to activate region-scoped session consistency. 

### Excluded regions

The excluded regions feature enables fine-grained control over request routing by allowing you to exclude specific regions from your preferred locations on a per-request basis. This feature is available in Azure Cosmos DB Java SDK version 4.47.0 and higher.

**Key benefits:**
- **Handle rate limiting**: When encountering 429 (Too Many Requests) responses, automatically route requests to alternate regions with available throughput
- **Targeted routing**: Ensure requests are served from specific regions by excluding all others
- **Bypass preferred order**: Override the default preferred regions list for individual requests without creating separate clients

**Configuration:**

Excluded regions can be configured at both the client level and request level:

```java
CosmosExcludedRegions excludedRegions = new CosmosExcludedRegions(Set.of("East US"));
// Using AtomicReference to simulate dynamic changes to excluded regions. Excluded regions can be set at the
// client level
AtomicReference<CosmosExcludedRegions> excludedRegionsAtomicReference = new AtomicReference<>(excludedRegions);
CosmosAsyncClient client = new CosmosClientBuilder()
    .endpoint("")
    .key("")
    .preferredRegions(List.of(new String[]{"West US", "East US"}))
    .excludedRegionsSupplier(excludedRegionsAtomicReference::get)
    .buildAsyncClient();
CosmosAsyncDatabase cosmosAsyncDatabase = client.getDatabase("Test");
CosmosAsyncContainer cosmosAsyncContainer = cosmosAsyncDatabase.getContainer("TestItems");
// Excluded regions can also be set at the request level
CosmosItemRequestOptions cosmosItemRequestOptions = new CosmosItemRequestOptions().setExcludedRegions(List.of("East US"));
TestObject testItem = TestObject.create("mypkValue");
cosmosAsyncContainer.createItem(testItem, cosmosItemRequestOptions).block();
```

#### Fine-tuning consistency vs availability

The excluded regions feature provides an additional mechanism for balancing consistency and availability trade-offs in your application. This capability is particularly valuable in dynamic scenarios where requirements may shift based on operational conditions:

**Dynamic outage handling**: When a primary region experiences an outage and partition-level circuit breaker thresholds prove insufficient, excluded regions enables immediate failover without code changes or application restarts. This provides faster response to regional issues compared to waiting for automatic circuit breaker activation.

**Conditional consistency preferences**: Applications can implement different consistency strategies based on operational state:
- **Steady state**: Prioritize consistent reads by excluding all regions except the primary, ensuring data consistency at the potential cost of availability
- **Outage scenarios**: Favor availability over strict consistency by allowing cross-region routing, accepting potential data lag in exchange for continued service availability

This approach allows external mechanisms (such as traffic managers or load balancers) to orchestrate failover decisions while the application maintains control over consistency requirements through region exclusion patterns.

When all regions are excluded, requests will be routed to the primary/hub region. This feature works with all request types including queries and is particularly useful for maintaining singleton client instances while achieving flexible routing behavior.

## Tuning direct and gateway connection configuration

For optimizing direct and gateway mode connection configurations, see how to [tune connection configurations for Java SDK v4](tune-connection-configurations-java-sdk-v4.md).

## SDK usage
* **Install the most recent SDK**

The Azure Cosmos DB SDKs are constantly being improved to provide the best performance. To determine the most recent SDK improvements, visit the [Azure Cosmos DB SDK](sdk-java-async-v2.md).

* <a id="max-connection"></a> **Use a singleton Azure Cosmos DB client for the lifetime of your application**

Each Azure Cosmos DB client instance is thread-safe and performs efficient connection management and address caching. To allow efficient connection management and better performance by the Azure Cosmos DB client, we strongly recommend using a single instance of the Azure Cosmos DB client for the lifetime of the application.

* <a id="override-default-consistency-javav4"></a> **Use the lowest consistency level required for your application**

When you create a *CosmosClient*, the default consistency used if not explicitly set is *Session*. If *Session* consistency is not required by your application logic set the *Consistency* to *Eventual*. Note: it is recommended using at least *Session* consistency in applications employing the Azure Cosmos DB Change Feed processor.

* **Use Async API to max out provisioned throughput**

Azure Cosmos DB Java SDK v4 bundles two APIs, Sync and Async. Roughly speaking, the Async API implements SDK functionality, whereas the Sync API is a thin wrapper that makes blocking calls to the Async API. This stands in contrast to the older Azure Cosmos DB Async Java SDK v2, which was Async-only, and to the older Azure Cosmos DB Sync Java SDK v2, which was Sync-only and had a separate implementation. 
    
The choice of API is determined during client initialization; a *CosmosAsyncClient* supports Async API while a *CosmosClient* supports Sync API. 
    
The Async API implements nonblocking IO and is the optimal choice if your goal is to max out throughput when issuing requests to Azure Cosmos DB. 
    
Using Sync API can be the right choice if you want or need an API, which blocks on the response to each request, or if synchronous operation is the dominant paradigm in your application. For example, you might want the Sync API when you are persisting data to Azure Cosmos DB in a microservices application, provided throughput is not critical.  
    
Note sync API throughput degrades with increasing request response-time, whereas the Async API can saturate the full bandwidth capabilities of your hardware. 
    
Geographic collocation can give you higher and more consistent throughput when using Sync API (see [Collocate clients in same Azure region for performance](#collocate-clients)) but still is not expected to exceed Async API attainable throughput.

Some users might also be unfamiliar with [Project Reactor](https://projectreactor.io/), the Reactive Streams framework used to implement Azure Cosmos DB Java SDK v4 Async API. If this is a concern, we recommend you read our introductory [Reactor Pattern Guide](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cosmos-java-sql-api-samples/blob/main/reactor-pattern-guide.md) and then take a look at this [Introduction to Reactive Programming](https://tech.io/playgrounds/929/reactive-programming-with-reactor-3/Intro) in order to familiarize yourself. If you have already used Azure Cosmos DB with an Async interface, and the SDK you used was Azure Cosmos DB Async Java SDK v2, then you might be familiar with [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/)/[RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) but be unsure what has changed in Project Reactor. In that case, take a look at our [Reactor vs. RxJava Guide](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cosmos-java-sql-api-samples/blob/main/reactor-rxjava-guide.md) to become familiarized.

The following code snippets show how to initialize your Azure Cosmos DB client for Async API or Sync API operation, respectively:

# [Async](#tab/api-async)

Java SDK V4 (Maven com.azure::azure-cosmos) Async API

[!code-java[](~/azure-cosmos-java-sql-api-samples/src/main/java/com/azure/cosmos/examples/documentationsnippets/async/SampleDocumentationSnippetsAsync.java?name=PerformanceClientAsync)]

# [Sync](#tab/api-sync)

Java SDK V4 (Maven com.azure::azure-cosmos) Sync API

[!code-java[](~/azure-cosmos-java-sql-api-samples/src/main/java/com/azure/cosmos/examples/documentationsnippets/sync/SampleDocumentationSnippets.java?name=PerformanceClientSync)]

 --- 

* **Scale out your client-workload**

If you are testing at high throughput levels, the client application might become the bottleneck due to the machine capping out on CPU or network utilization. If you reach this point, you can continue to push the Azure Cosmos DB account further by scaling out your client applications across multiple servers.

A good rule of thumb is not to exceed >50% CPU utilization on any given server, to keep latency low.

<a id="tune-page-size"></a>

* **Use Appropriate Scheduler (Avoid stealing Event loop IO Netty threads)**

The asynchronous functionality of Azure Cosmos DB Java SDK is based on [netty](https://netty.io/) non-blocking IO. The SDK uses a fixed number of IO netty event loop threads (as many CPU cores your machine has) for executing IO operations. The Flux returned by API emits the result on one of the shared IO event loop netty threads. So it is important to not block the shared IO event loop netty threads. Doing CPU intensive work or blocking operation on the IO event loop netty thread might cause deadlock or significantly reduce SDK throughput.

For example the following code executes a cpu intensive work on the event loop IO netty thread:
<a id="java4-noscheduler"></a>

[!code-java[](~/azure-cosmos-java-sql-api-samples/src/main/java/com/azure/cosmos/examples/documentationsnippets/async/SampleDocumentationSnippetsAsync.java?name=PerformanceNeedsSchedulerAsync)]

After the result is received, you should avoid doing any CPU intensive work on the result on the event loop IO netty thread. You can instead provide your own Scheduler to provide your own thread for running your work, as shown below (requires `import reactor.core.scheduler.Schedulers`).

<a id="java4-scheduler"></a>

[!code-java[](~/azure-cosmos-java-sql-api-samples/src/main/java/com/azure/cosmos/examples/documentationsnippets/async/SampleDocumentationSnippetsAsync.java?name=PerformanceAddSchedulerAsync)]

Based on the type of your work, you should use the appropriate existing Reactor Scheduler for your work. Read here
[``Schedulers``](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/scheduler/Schedulers.html).

To further understand the threading and scheduling model of project Reactor, refer to this [blog post by Project Reactor](https://spring.io/blog/2019/12/13/flight-of-the-flux-3-hopping-threads-and-schedulers).

For more information on Azure Cosmos DB Java SDK v4, look at the [Azure Cosmos DB directory of the Azure SDK for Java monorepo on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/tree/master/sdk/cosmos/azure-cosmos).

* **Optimize logging settings in your application**

For various reasons, you should add logging in a thread that is generating high request throughput. If your goal is to fully saturate a container's provisioned throughput with requests generated by this thread, logging optimizations can greatly improve performance.

* **Configure an async logger**

The latency of a synchronous logger necessarily factors into the overall latency calculation of your request-generating thread. An async logger such as [log4j2](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/log4j-2.3/manual/async.html) is recommended to decouple logging overhead from your high-performance application threads.

* **Disable netty's logging**

Netty library logging is chatty and needs to be turned off (suppressing sign in the configuration might not be enough) to avoid additional CPU costs. If you are not in debugging mode, disable netty's logging altogether. So if you are using Log4j to remove the additional CPU costs incurred by ``org.apache.log4j.Category.callAppenders()`` from netty add the following line to your codebase:

```java
org.apache.log4j.Logger.getLogger("io.netty").setLevel(org.apache.log4j.Level.OFF);
```

 * **OS Open files Resource Limit**
 
Some Linux systems (like Red Hat) have an upper limit on the number of open files and so the total number of connections. Run the following to view the current limits:

```bash
ulimit -a
```

The number of open files (`nofile`) needs to be large enough to have enough room for your configured connection pool size and other open files by the OS. It can be modified to allow for a larger connection pool size.

Open the limits.conf file:

```bash
vim /etc/security/limits.conf
```
    
Add/modify the following lines:

```
* - nofile 100000
```

* **Specify partition key in point writes**

To improve the performance of point writes, specify item partition key in the point write API call, as shown below:

# [Async](#tab/api-async)

Java SDK V4 (Maven com.azure::azure-cosmos) Async API

[!code-java[](~/azure-cosmos-java-sql-api-samples/src/main/java/com/azure/cosmos/examples/documentationsnippets/async/SampleDocumentationSnippetsAsync.java?name=PerformanceNoPKAsync)]

# [Sync](#tab/api-sync)

Java SDK V4 (Maven com.azure::azure-cosmos) Sync API

[!code-java[](~/azure-cosmos-java-sql-api-samples/src/main/java/com/azure/cosmos/examples/documentationsnippets/sync/SampleDocumentationSnippets.java?name=PerformanceNoPKSync)]

--- 

Rather than providing only the item instance, as shown below:

# [Async](#tab/api-async)

Java SDK V4 (Maven com.azure::azure-cosmos) Async API

[!code-java[](~/azure-cosmos-java-sql-api-samples/src/main/java/com/azure/cosmos/examples/documentationsnippets/async/SampleDocumentationSnippetsAsync.java?name=PerformanceAddPKAsync)]

# [Sync](#tab/api-sync)

Java SDK V4 (Maven com.azure::azure-cosmos) Sync API

[!code-java[](~/azure-cosmos-java-sql-api-samples/src/main/java/com/azure/cosmos/examples/documentationsnippets/sync/SampleDocumentationSnippets.java?name=PerformanceAddPKSync)]

--- 

The latter is supported but will add latency to your application; the SDK must parse the item and extract the partition key.


## Query operations

* **Exclude unused paths from indexing for faster writes**

Azure Cosmos DB’s indexing policy allows you to specify which document paths to include or exclude from indexing by using Indexing Paths (setIncludedPaths and setExcludedPaths). The use of indexing paths can offer improved write performance and lower index storage for scenarios in which the query patterns are known beforehand, as indexing costs are directly correlated to the number of unique paths indexed. For example, the following code shows how to include and exclude entire sections of the documents (also known as a subtree) from indexing using the "*" wildcard.

## Throughput
<a id="measure-rus"></a>

* **Measure and tune for lower request units/second usage**

Azure Cosmos DB offers a rich set of database operations including relational and hierarchical queries with UDFs, stored procedures, and triggers – all operating on the documents within a database collection. The cost associated with each of these operations varies based on the CPU, IO, and memory required to complete the operation. Instead of thinking about and managing hardware resources, you can think of a request unit (RU) as a single measure for the resources required to perform various database operations and service an application request.

Throughput is provisioned based on the number of [request units](../request-units.md) set for each container. Request unit consumption is evaluated as a rate per second. Applications that exceed the provisioned request unit rate for their container are limited until the rate drops below the provisioned level for the container. If your application requires a higher level of throughput, you can increase your throughput by provisioning additional request units.

The complexity of a query impacts how many request units are consumed for an operation. The number of predicates, nature of the predicates, number of UDFs, and the size of the source data set all influence the cost of query operations.

To measure the overhead of any operation (create, update, or delete), inspect the [x-ms-request-charge](/rest/api/cosmos-db/common-cosmosdb-rest-request-headers) header to measure the number of request units consumed by these operations. You can also look at the equivalent RequestCharge property in ResourceResponse\<T> or FeedResponse\<T>.

The request charge returned in this header is a fraction of your provisioned throughput. For example, if you have 2000 RU/s provisioned, and if the preceding query returns 1,000 1KB documents, the cost of the operation is 1000. As such, within one second, the server honors only two such requests before rate limiting subsequent requests. For more information, see [Request units](../request-units.md) and the [request unit calculator](https://cosmos.azure.com/capacitycalculator).

<a id="429"></a>
* **Handle rate limiting/request rate too large**

When a client attempts to exceed the reserved throughput for an account, there is no performance degradation at the server and no use of throughput capacity beyond the reserved level. The server will preemptively end the request with RequestRateTooLarge (HTTP status code 429) and return the [x-ms-retry-after-ms](/rest/api/cosmos-db/common-cosmosdb-rest-request-headers) header indicating the amount of time, in milliseconds, that the user must wait before reattempting the request.

```xml
HTTP Status 429,
Status Line: RequestRateTooLarge
x-ms-retry-after-ms :100
```

The SDKs all implicitly catch this response, respect the server-specified retry-after header, and retry the request. Unless your account is being accessed concurrently by multiple clients, the next retry will succeed.

If you have more than one client cumulatively operating consistently above the request rate, the default retry count currently set to 9 internally by the client might not suffice; in this case, the client throws a *CosmosClientException* with status code 429 to the application. The default retry count can be changed by using `setMaxRetryAttemptsOnThrottledRequests()` on the `ThrottlingRetryOptions` instance. By default, the *CosmosClientException* with status code 429 is returned after a cumulative wait time of 30 seconds if the request continues to operate above the request rate. This occurs even when the current retry count is less than the max retry count, be it the default of 9 or a user-defined value.

While the automated retry behavior helps to improve resiliency and usability for the most applications, it might come at odds when doing performance benchmarks, especially when measuring latency. The client-observed latency will spike if the experiment hits the server throttle and causes the client SDK to silently retry. To avoid latency spikes during performance experiments, measure the charge returned by each operation and ensure that requests are operating below the reserved request rate. For more information, see [Request units](../request-units.md).

* **Design for smaller documents for higher throughput**

The request charge (the request processing cost) of a given operation is directly correlated to the size of the document. Operations on large documents cost more than operations for small documents. Ideally, architect your application and workflows to have your item size be ~1 KB, or similar order or magnitude. For latency-sensitive applications large items should be avoided - multi-MB documents slow down your application.
