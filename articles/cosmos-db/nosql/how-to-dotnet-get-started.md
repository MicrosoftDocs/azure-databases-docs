# Get started with Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL using .NET

[!INCLUDE[NoSQL](../includes/appliesto-nosql.md)]

This article shows you how to connect to Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL using the .NET SDK. Once connected, you can perform operations on databases, containers, and items.

[Package (NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos) | [Samples](samples-dotnet.md) | [API reference](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmos) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cosmos-dotnet-v3) | [Give Feedback](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cosmos-dotnet-v3/issues)

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).
- Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account. [Create a API for NoSQL account](how-to-create-account.md).
- [.NET 6.0 or later](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI)](/cli/azure/) or [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/)

## Set up your project

Create a new .NET application by using the [``dotnet new``](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new) command with the **console** template.

```dotnetcli
dotnet new console
```

Import the [Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos) NuGet package using the [``dotnet add package``](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-add-package) command.

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos
```

Build the project with the [``dotnet build``](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-build) command.

```dotnetcli
dotnet build
```

## Connect to Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL

To connect to the API for NoSQL of Azure Cosmos DB, create an instance of the [`CosmosClient`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmos.cosmosclient) class. This class is the starting point to perform all operations against databases.

To connect to your API for NoSQL account using Microsoft Entra, use a security principal. The exact type of principal will depend on where you host your application code. The table below serves as a quick reference guide.

| Where the application runs | Security principal
|--|--|---|
| Local machine (developing and testing) | User identity or service principal |
| Azure | Managed identity |
| Servers or clients outside of Azure | Service principal |

### Import Azure.Identity

The **Azure.Identity** NuGet package contains core authentication functionality that is shared among all Azure SDK libraries.

Import the [Azure.Identity](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Identity) NuGet package using the ``dotnet add package`` command.

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Azure.Identity
```

Rebuild the project with the ``dotnet build`` command.

```dotnetcli
dotnet build
```

In your code editor, add using directives for ``Azure.Core`` and ``Azure.Identity`` namespaces.

:::code language="csharp" source="~/cosmos-db-nosql-dotnet-samples/103-client-default-credential/Program.cs" id="using_identity_directives":::

### Create CosmosClient with default credential implementation

If you're testing on a local machine, or your application will run on Azure services with direct support for managed identities, obtain an OAuth token by creating a [``DefaultAzureCredential``](/dotnet/api/azure.identity.defaultazurecredential) instance.

For this example, we saved the instance in a variable of type [``TokenCredential``](/dotnet/api/azure.core.tokencredential) as that's a more generic type that's reusable across SDKs.

:::code language="csharp" source="~/cosmos-db-nosql-dotnet-samples/103-client-default-credential/Program.cs" id="credential":::

Create a new instance of the **CosmosClient** class with the ``COSMOS_ENDPOINT`` environment variable and the **TokenCredential** object as parameters.

:::code language="csharp" source="~/cosmos-db-nosql-dotnet-samples/103-client-default-credential/Program.cs" id="default_credential" highlight="4":::

## Build your application

As you build your application, your code will primarily interact with four types of resources:

- The API for NoSQL account, which is the unique top-level namespace for your Azure Cosmos DB data.

- Databases, which organize the containers in your account.

- Containers, which contain a set of individual items in your database.

- Items, which represent a JSON document in your container.

The following diagram shows the relationship between these resources.

:::image type="complex" source="media/how-to-dotnet-get-started/resource-hierarchy.svg" alt-text="Diagram of the Azure Cosmos DB hierarchy including accounts, databases, containers, and items." border="false":::

:::image-end:::

Each type of resource is represented by one or more associated .NET classes. Here's a list of the most common classes:

| Class | Description |
|---|---|
| [``CosmosClient``](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmos.cosmosclient) | This class provides a client-side logical representation for the Azure Cosmos DB service. The client object is used to configure and execute requests against the service. |
| [``Database``](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmos.database) | This class is a reference to a database that may, or may not, exist in the service yet. The database is validated server-side when you attempt to access it or perform an operation against it. |
| [``Container``](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmos.container) | This class is a reference to a container that also may not exist in the service yet. The container is validated server-side when you attempt to work with it. |

The following guides show you how to use each of these classes to build your application.

| Guide | Description |
|--|---|
| [Create a database](how-to-dotnet-create-database.md) | Create databases |
| [Create a container](how-to-dotnet-create-container.md) | Create containers |
| [Read an item](how-to-dotnet-read-item.md) | Point read a specific item |
| [Query items](how-to-dotnet-query-items.md) | Query multiple items |
