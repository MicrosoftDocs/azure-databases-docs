# Azure Cosmos DB Java SDK v4 for API for NoSQL: release notes and resources
[!INCLUDE[NoSQL](../includes/appliesto-nosql.md)]

[!INCLUDE[SDK selector](../includes/cosmos-db-sdk-list.md)]

The Azure Cosmos DB Java SDK v4 for NoSQL combines an Async API and a Sync API into one Maven artifact. The v4 SDK brings enhanced performance, new API features, and Async support based on Project Reactor and the [Netty library](https://netty.io/). Users can expect improved performance with Azure Cosmos DB Java SDK v4 versus the [Azure Cosmos DB Async Java SDK v2](sdk-java-async-v2.md) and the [Azure Cosmos DB Sync Java SDK v2](/java/api/overview/azure/cosmos-readme).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> These Release Notes are for Azure Cosmos DB Java SDK v4 only. If you are currently using an older version than v4, see the [Migrate to Azure Cosmos DB Java SDK v4](migrate-java-v4-sdk.md) guide for help upgrading to v4.
>
> Here are three steps to get going fast!
> 1. Install the [minimum supported Java runtime, JDK 8](/java/azure/jdk/) so you can use the SDK.
> 2. Work through the [Quickstart Guide for Azure Cosmos DB Java SDK v4](./quickstart-java.md) which gets you access to the Maven artifact and walks through basic Azure Cosmos DB requests.
> 3. Read the Azure Cosmos DB Java SDK v4 [performance tips](performance-tips-java-sdk-v4.md) and [troubleshooting](troubleshoot-java-sdk-v4.md) guides to optimize the SDK for your application.
>
> The [Azure Cosmos DB workshops and labs](https://aka.ms/cosmosworkshop) are another great resource for learning how to use Azure Cosmos DB Java SDK v4!
