> [!WARNING]
> Resource Owner Password Credential (ROPC) flow isn't recommended for production Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL workloads as it requires handling credentials directly, which poses security risks. For more secure authentication, use role-based access control with Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, see [role-based access control and Microsoft Entra ID authentication in Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](../how-to-connect-role-based-access-control.md).
