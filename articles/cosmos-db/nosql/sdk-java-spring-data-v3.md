# Spring Data Azure Cosmos DB v3 for API for NoSQL (legacy): Release notes and resources
[!INCLUDE[NoSQL](../includes/appliesto-nosql.md)]

[!INCLUDE[SDK selector](../includes/cosmos-db-sdk-list.md)]

The Spring Data Azure Cosmos DB version 3 for NoSQL allows developers to use Azure Cosmos DB in Spring applications. Spring Data Azure Cosmos DB exposes the Spring Data interface for manipulating databases and collections, working with documents, and issuing queries. Both Sync and Async (Reactive) APIs are supported in the same Maven artifact. 

> [!WARNING]
> This version of Spring Data Azure Cosmos DB SDK depends on an older version of Spring Boot and Azure Cosmos DB Java SDK. This Spring Data Azure Cosmos DB SDK will be announced as retiring in the near future! This is *not* the latest Azure Spring Data Azure Cosmos DB SDK for Azure Cosmos DB and is outdated. Because of performance issues and instability in Azure Spring Data Azure Cosmos DB SDK V3, we highly recommend to use [Azure Spring Data Azure Cosmos DB v5](sdk-java-spring-data-v5.md) for your project. To upgrade, follow the instructions in the [Migrate to Azure Cosmos DB Java SDK v4](migrate-java-v4-sdk.md) guide to understand the difference in the underlying Java SDK V4.

The [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework) is a programming and configuration model that streamlines Java application development. Spring streamlines the "plumbing" of applications by using dependency injection. Many developers like Spring because it makes building and testing applications more straightforward. [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) extends this handling of the plumbing with an eye toward web application and microservices development. [Spring Data](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data) is a programming model and framework for accessing datastores like Azure Cosmos DB from the context of a Spring or Spring Boot application. 

You can use Spring Data Azure Cosmos DB in your applications hosted in [Azure Spring Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/spring-apps/).

## Version support policy

### Spring Data version support

This project supports different spring-data-commons versions. Visit [spring data version support](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/tree/main/sdk/spring/azure-spring-data-cosmos#spring-data-version-support) for more information.

### Which version of Azure Spring Data Azure Cosmos DB should I use

Azure Spring Data Azure Cosmos DB library supports multiple versions of Spring Boot / Spring Cloud. Refer to [Azure Spring Data Azure Cosmos DB version mapping](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/tree/main/sdk/spring/azure-spring-data-cosmos/README.md#which-version-of-azure-spring-data-cosmos-should-i-use) for detailed information on which version of Azure Spring Data Azure Cosmos DB to use with Spring Boot / Spring Cloud version.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> These release notes are for version 3 of Spring Data Azure Cosmos DB. 
>
> Azure Spring Data Azure Cosmos DB SDK has dependency on the Spring Data framework, and supports only the API for NoSQL. 
>
> See these articles for information about Spring Data on other Azure Cosmos DB APIs:
> * [Spring Data for Apache Cassandra with Azure Cosmos DB](/azure/developer/java/spring-framework/configure-spring-data-apache-cassandra-with-cosmos-db)
> * [Spring Data MongoDB with Azure Cosmos DB](/azure/developer/java/spring-framework/configure-spring-data-mongodb-with-cosmos-db)

## Get started fast

  Get up and running with Spring Data Azure Cosmos DB by following our [Spring Boot Starter guide](/azure/developer/java/spring-framework/configure-spring-boot-starter-java-app-with-cosmos-db). The Spring Boot Starter approach is the recommended way to get started using the Spring Data Azure Cosmos DB connector.

  Alternatively, you can add the Spring Data Azure Cosmos DB dependency to your `pom.xml` file as shown below:

  ```xml
  <dependency>
      <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
      <artifactId>azure-spring-data-cosmos</artifactId>
      <version>latest-version</version>
  </dependency>
  ```
