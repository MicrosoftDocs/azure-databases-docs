# Tutorial: Set up global distribution using Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL

[!INCLUDE[NoSQL](../includes/appliesto-nosql.md)]

In this article, we show how to use the Azure portal to set up Azure Cosmos DB global distribution and then connect using the API for NoSQL.

This article covers the following tasks:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Configure global distribution using the Azure portal
> * Configure global distribution using the [API for NoSQLs](../introduction.md)

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-tutorial-global-distribution-portal](../includes/cosmos-db-tutorial-global-distribution-portal.md)]

## <a id="preferred-locations"></a> Connecting to a preferred region using the API for NoSQL

In order to take advantage of [global distribution](../distribute-data-globally.md), client applications can specify the ordered preference list of regions to be used to perform document operations. Based on the Azure Cosmos DB account configuration, current regional availability and the preference list specified, the most optimal endpoint will be chosen by the SQL SDK to perform write and read operations.

This preference list is specified when initializing a connection using the SQL SDKs. The SDKs accept an optional parameter `PreferredLocations` that is an ordered list of Azure regions.

The SDK will automatically send all writes to the current write region. All reads are sent to the first available region in the preferred locations list. If the request fails, the client will fail down the list to the next region.

The SDK will only attempt to read from the regions specified in preferred locations. So, for example, if the Azure Cosmos DB account is available in four regions, but the client only specifies two read(non-write) regions within the `PreferredLocations`, then no reads will be served out of the read region that is not specified in `PreferredLocations`. If the read regions specified in the `PreferredLocations` list are not available, reads will be served out of write region.

The application can verify the current write endpoint and read endpoint chosen by the SDK by checking two properties, `WriteEndpoint` and `ReadEndpoint`, available in SDK version 1.8 and above. If the `PreferredLocations` property is not set, all requests will be served from the current write region.

If you don't specify the preferred locations but used the `setCurrentLocation` method, the SDK automatically populates the preferred locations based on the current region that the client is running in. The SDK orders the regions based on the proximity of a region to the current region.

## .NET SDK

The SDK can be used without any code changes. In this case, the SDK automatically directs both reads and writes to the current write region.
In version 1.8 and later of the .NET SDK, the ConnectionPolicy parameter for the DocumentClient constructor has a property called Microsoft.Azure.Documents.ConnectionPolicy.PreferredLocations. This property is of type Collection `<string>` and should contain a list of region names. The string values are formatted per the region name column on the [Azure Regions][regions] page, with no spaces before or after the first and last character respectively.

The current write and read endpoints are available in DocumentClient.WriteEndpoint and DocumentClient.ReadEndpoint respectively.

> [!NOTE]
> The URLs for the endpoints should not be considered as long-lived constants. The service may update these at any point. The SDK handles this change automatically.

# [.NET SDK V2](#tab/dotnetv2)

If you are using the .NET V2 SDK, use the `PreferredLocations` property to set the preferred region.

```csharp
// Getting endpoints from application settings or other configuration location
Uri accountEndPoint = new Uri(Properties.Settings.Default.GlobalDatabaseUri);

ConnectionPolicy connectionPolicy = new ConnectionPolicy();

//Setting read region selection preference
connectionPolicy.PreferredLocations.Add(LocationNames.WestUS); // first preference
connectionPolicy.PreferredLocations.Add(LocationNames.EastUS); // second preference
connectionPolicy.PreferredLocations.Add(LocationNames.NorthEurope); // third preference
// initialize connection
DocumentClient docClient = new DocumentClient(
    accountEndPoint,
    credential,
    connectionPolicy);

// connect to DocDB
await docClient.OpenAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);
```

Alternatively, you can use the `SetCurrentLocation` property and let the SDK choose the preferred location based on proximity.

```csharp
// Getting endpoints from application settings or other configuration location
Uri accountEndPoint = new Uri(Properties.Settings.Default.GlobalDatabaseUri);

ConnectionPolicy connectionPolicy = new ConnectionPolicy();

connectionPolicy.SetCurrentLocation("West US 2"); /

// initialize connection
DocumentClient docClient = new DocumentClient(
    accountEndPoint,
    credential,
    connectionPolicy);

// connect to DocDB
await docClient.OpenAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);
```

# [.NET SDK V3](#tab/dotnetv3)

If you are using the .NET V3 SDK, use the `ApplicationPreferredRegions` property to set the preferred region.

```csharp
CosmosClientOptions options = new CosmosClientOptions();
options.ApplicationName = "MyApp";
options.ApplicationPreferredRegions = new List<string> {Regions.WestUS, Regions.WestUS2};

CosmosClient client = new CosmosClient(endpoint, credential, options);
```

Alternatively, you can use the `ApplicationRegion` property and let the SDK choose the preferred location based on proximity.

```csharp
CosmosClientOptions options = new CosmosClientOptions();
options.ApplicationName = "MyApp";
// If the application is running in West US
options.ApplicationRegion = Regions.WestUS;

CosmosClient client = new CosmosClient(endpoint, tokenCredential, options);
```

## Node.js/JavaScript

> [!NOTE]
> The URLs for the endpoints should not be considered as long-lived constants. The service may update these at any point. The SDK will handle this change automatically.
>

Below is a code example for Node.js/JavaScript.

```JavaScript
// Setting read region selection preference, in the following order -
// 1 - West US
// 2 - East US
// 3 - North Europe
const preferredLocations = ['West US', 'East US', 'North Europe'];

// initialize the connection
const client = new CosmosClient({ endpoint, aadCredentials: tokenCredential, connectionPolicy: { preferredLocations } });
```

## Python SDK

The following code shows how to set preferred locations by using the Python SDK:

```python
connectionPolicy = documents.ConnectionPolicy()
connectionPolicy.PreferredLocations = ['West US', 'East US', 'North Europe']
client = cosmos_client.CosmosClient(ENDPOINT, credential=token_credential, connectionPolicy)
```

## <a id="java4-preferred-locations"></a> Java V4 SDK

The following code shows how to set preferred locations by using the Java SDK:

# [Async](#tab/api-async)

```java
ArrayList<String> preferredRegions = new ArrayList<String>();
preferredRegions.add("East US");
preferredRegions.add( "West US");
preferredRegions.add("Canada Central");

CosmosAsyncClient client =
        new CosmosClientBuilder()
                .endpoint(HOST)
                .credential(tokenCredential)
                .preferredRegions(preferredRegions)
                .contentResponseOnWriteEnabled(true)
                .buildAsyncClient();
```

# [Sync](#tab/api-sync)

```java
ArrayList<String> preferredRegions = new ArrayList<String>();
preferredRegions.add("East US");
preferredRegions.add( "West US");
preferredRegions.add("Canada Central");

CosmosClient client =
        new CosmosClientBuilder()
                .endpoint(HOST)
                .credential(tokenCredential)
                .preferredRegions(preferredRegions)
                .contentResponseOnWriteEnabled(true)
                .buildClient();
```

## Spark 3 Connector

You can define the preferred regional list using the `spark.cosmos.preferredRegionsList` [configuration](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/cosmos/azure-cosmos-spark_3_2-12/docs/configuration-reference.md), for example:

```scala
val sparkConnectorConfig = Map(
  "spark.cosmos.accountEndpoint" -> cosmosEndpoint,
  "spark.cosmos.preferredRegionsList" -> "[West US, East US, North Europe]"
  // other settings
)
```

## REST

Once a database account has been made available in multiple regions, clients can query its availability by performing a GET request on this  URI `https://{databaseaccount}.documents.azure.com/`

The service will return a list of regions and their corresponding Azure Cosmos DB endpoint URIs for the replicas. The current write region will be indicated in the response. The client can then select the appropriate endpoint for all further REST API requests as follows.

Example response

```json
{
    "_dbs": "//dbs/",
    "media": "//media/",
    "writableLocations": [
        {
            "Name": "West US",
            "DatabaseAccountEndpoint": "https://globaldbexample-westus.documents.azure.com:443/"
        }
    ],
    "readableLocations": [
        {
            "Name": "East US",
            "DatabaseAccountEndpoint": "https://globaldbexample-eastus.documents.azure.com:443/"
        }
    ],
    "MaxMediaStorageUsageInMB": 2048,
    "MediaStorageUsageInMB": 0,
    "ConsistencyPolicy": {
        "defaultConsistencyLevel": "Session",
        "maxStalenessPrefix": 100,
        "maxIntervalInSeconds": 5
    },
    "addresses": "//addresses/",
    "id": "globaldbexample",
    "_rid": "globaldbexample.documents.azure.com",
    "_self": "",
    "_ts": 0,
    "_etag": null
}
```

* All PUT, POST, and DELETE requests must go to the indicated write URI
* All GETs and other read-only requests (for example queries) may go to any endpoint of the client's choice

Write requests to read-only regions will fail with HTTP error code 403 ("Forbidden").

If the write region changes after the client's initial discovery phase, subsequent writes to the previous write region will fail with HTTP error code 403 ("Forbidden"). The client should then GET the list of regions again to get the updated write region.

That's it, that completes this tutorial. You can learn how to manage the consistency of your globally replicated account by reading [Consistency levels in Azure Cosmos DB](../consistency-levels.md). And for more information about how global database replication works in Azure Cosmos DB, see [Distribute data globally with Azure Cosmos DB](../distribute-data-globally.md).
