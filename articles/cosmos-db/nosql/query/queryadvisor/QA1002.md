# QA1002: Contains

| Property      | Value            |

| RuleID        | QA1002           |

## Cause
The query uses the `CONTAINS` function.

## Rule Description
`CONTAINS` can be expensive and slow because it requires a full scan.

## Recommendation
If the intention of using `CONTAINS` is to match on a string prefix, use `STARTSWITH` instead, which performs a precise index scan and can be more cost-efficient.

If you are performing a case-insensitive string search, consider defining and indexing a computed property that projects `LOWER(c.stringSearchProperty)` and use case-sensitive string search instead.
## Example
Original query:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM c 
WHERE CONTAINS(c.category, "Historical")
```

The intention of the above query is to search for `category` that starts with `Historical`. In this case, the following query has better performance:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM c 
WHERE STARTSWITH(c.category, "Historical")
```
