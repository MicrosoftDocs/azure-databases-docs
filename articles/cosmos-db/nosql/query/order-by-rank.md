# ORDER BY RANK (NoSQL query)

[!INCLUDE[NoSQL](../../includes/appliesto-nosql.md)]

The optional ``ORDER BY RANK`` clause sorts scoring functions by their rank. It's used specifically for scoring functions like `VectorDistance`, `FullTextScore`, and `RRF`.

## Syntax

```nosql
ORDER BY RANK <scoring function>
```  

## Arguments

| | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **``<scoring function>``** | Specifies a scoring function like `VectorDistance`, `FullTextScore`, or RRF. |

> [!NOTE]
> For more information on scalar expressions, see [scalar expressions](scalar-expressions.md).

## Examples

This is a simple example showing how to use `FullTextScore` with `ORDER BY RANK` to sort from highest relevancy to lowest relevancy.

```nosql
SELECT TOP 10 c.text
FROM c
ORDER BY RANK FullTextScore(c.text, ["keyword"])
```

This next example shows use `RRF` in the `ORDER BY RANK` clause to combine `VectorDistance` similarity scores with `FullTextScore` BM25 scores to execute a hybrid search

```nosql
SELECT TOP 10 c.text
FROM c
WHERE FullTextContains(c.text, "keyword1")
ORDER BY RANK RRF(FullTextScore(c.text, ["keyword1", "keyword2"]), VectorDistance(c.vector, [1,2,3]))
```

## Remarks  

- This function requires enrollment in the [Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL Full Text Search preview feature](../../gen-ai/full-text-search.md)
- This function requires a [Full Text Index](../../index-policy.md)
- Hybrid Search also requires enrollment in [Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL Vector Search](../vector-search.md)
