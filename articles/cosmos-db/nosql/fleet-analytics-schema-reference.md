# Fleet analytics schema reference (preview)

> [!NOTE]
> Do you have any feedback about Azure Cosmos DB Fleets? We want to hear it! Feel free to share feedback directly with the Azure Cosmos DB engineering team: [azurecosmosdbfleetfeedback@microsoft.com](mailto:azurecosmosdbfleetfeedback@microsoft.com).

These tables document the entire schema of the data exposed by Azure Cosmos DB fleet analytics.
