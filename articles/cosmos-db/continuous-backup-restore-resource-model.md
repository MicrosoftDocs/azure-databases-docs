# Resource model for the Azure Cosmos DB point-in-time restore feature

[!INCLUDE[NoSQL, MongoDB, Gremlin, Table](includes/appliesto-nosql-mongodb-gremlin-table.md)]

This article explains the resource model for the Azure Cosmos DB point-in-time restore feature. It explains the parameters that support the continuous backup and resources that can be restored. This feature is supported in Azure Cosmos DB API for SQL, Azure Cosmos DB API for Gremlin, Table API and the Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB.  

## Database account's resource model

The database account's resource model is updated with a few extra properties to support the new restore scenarios. These properties are `BackupPolicy`, `CreateMode`, and `RestoreParameters`.

### BackupPolicy

A new property in the account level backup policy named ``Type`` under the ``backuppolicy`` parameter enables continuous backup and point-in-time restore. This mode is referred to as **continuous backup**. You can set this mode when creating the account or while [migrating an account from periodic to continuous mode](migrate-continuous-backup.md). After continuous mode is enabled, all the containers and databases created within this account will have point-in-time restore and continuous backup enabled by default. The continuous backup tier can be set to ``Continuous7Days`` or ``Continuous30Days``. By default, if no tier is provided, ``Continuous30Days`` is applied on the account.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently the point-in-time restore feature is available for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL, API for MongoDB, Table and Gremlin accounts. After you create an account with continuous mode you can't switch it to a periodic mode. The ``Continuous7Days`` tier is in preview.

### CreateMode

This property indicates how the account was created. The possible values are *Default* and *Restore*. To perform a restore, set this value to *Restore* and provide the appropriate values in the `RestoreParameters` property.

### publicNetworkAccess
This property needs to be set to 'Disabled' to restore account without public network access. If this property is not provided, restore of the account will proceed with publicNetworkAccess as `Enabled`. 

### RestoreParameters

The `RestoreParameters` resource contains the restore operation details including, the account ID, the time to restore, and resources that need to be restored.

| Property Name | Description  |
| --- | --- |
| ``restoreMode`` | The restore mode should be ``PointInTime``. |
| ``restoreSource`` |  The instanceId of the source account from which the restore will be initiated. |
| ``restoreTimestampInUtc`` | Point in time in UTC to restore the account. |
| ``databasesToRestore`` | List of `DatabaseRestoreResource` objects to specify which databases and containers should be restored. Each resource represents a single database and all the collections under that database. For more information, see [restorable SQL resources](#restorable-sql-resources). If this value is empty, then the entire account is restored. |
| ``gremlinDatabasesToRestore`` | List of `GremlinDatabaseRestoreResource` objects to specify which databases and graphs should be restored. Each resource represents a single database and all the graphs under that database. For more information, see [restorable Gremlin resources](#restorable-graph-resources). If this value is empty, then the entire account is restored. |
| ``restoreWithTtlDisabled`` |  boolean flag values (true/false) to disable Time-To-Live in the restored account upon completion of the restore. (preview)  | 
| ``tablesToRestore`` | List of `TableRestoreResource` objects to specify which tables should be restored. Each resource represents a table under that database. For more information, see [restorable Table resources](#restorable-table-resources). If this value is empty, then the entire account is restored. |

### Sample resource

The following JSON is a sample database account resource with continuous backup enabled:

      ]
    },
    "backupPolicy": {
      "type": "Continuous"
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

## Restorable resources

A set of new resources and APIs is available to help you discover critical information about resources, which includes:

* Where the resources can be restored
* Locations where the resources can be restored from
* Timestamps when key operations were performed on these resources.

> [!NOTE]
> All the API used to enumerate these resources require the following permissions:
>
> * `Microsoft.DocumentDB/locations/restorableDatabaseAccounts/*/read`
> * `Microsoft.DocumentDB/locations/restorableDatabaseAccounts/read`
>
