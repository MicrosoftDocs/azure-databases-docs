# Priority-based execution in Azure Cosmos DB

[!INCLUDE[NoSQL](includes/appliesto-nosql.md)]

Priority based execution allows users to specify priority of requests sent to Azure Cosmos DB. In cases where the number of requests exceeds the capacity that can be processed within the configured Request Units per second (RU/s), then Azure Cosmos DB throttles low priority requests to prioritize the execution of high priority requests.

This feature enables users to execute critical tasks while delaying less important tasks when the total consumption of container exceeds the configured RU/s in high load scenarios by implementing throttling measures for low priority requests first. Any client application using SDK retries low priority requests in accordance with the [retry policy](../../articles/cosmos-db/nosql/conceptual-resilient-sdk-applications.md) configured.


> [!NOTE]
> Priority-based execution feature doesn't guarantee always throttling low priority requests in favor of high priority ones. This operates on best-effort basis and there are no SLA's linked to the performance of the feature.

## Use-cases

You can use priority-based execution when your application has different priorities for workloads running on the same container. For example, 

- Prioritizing read, write, or query operations.  
- Prioritizing user actions vs background operations like  
    - Stored procedures 
    - Data ingestion/migration 

## Getting started

To get started using priority-based execution, navigate to the **Features** page in you're in Azure Cosmos DB account. Select and enable the **Priority-based execution (preview)** feature.

## SDK requirements

- Java v4: [v4.45.0](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.azure/azure-cosmos/4.45.0) or later
- Spark 3.2: [v4.19.0](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.azure.cosmos.spark/azure-cosmos-spark_3-2_2-12/4.19.0) or later
- JavaScript v4: [v4.0.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/cosmos) or later
- Python: [v4.5.2b2](https://pypi.org/project/azure-cosmos/4.5.2b2/) or later. Available only in preview version.

## Code samples

#### [.NET SDK v3](#tab/net-v3)

```csharp
using Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos;

//update products catalog with low priority
RequestOptions catalogRequestOptions = new ItemRequestOptions{PriorityLevel = PriorityLevel.Low}; 

PartitionKey pk = new PartitionKey(“productId1”); 
ItemResponse<Product> catalogResponse = await this.container.CreateItemAsync<Product>(product1, pk, requestOptions); 

//Display product information to user with high priority
RequestOptions getProductRequestOptions = new ItemRequestOptions{PriorityLevel = PriorityLevel.High}; 

string id = “productId2”; 
PartitionKey pk = new PartitionKey(id); 

ItemResponse<Product> productResponse = await this.container.ReadItemAsync< Product>(id, pk, getProductRequestOptions); 
```

#### [Java SDK v4](#tab/java-v4)

```java
import com.azure.cosmos.ThroughputControlGroupConfig;
import com.azure.cosmos.ThroughputControlGroupConfigBuilder;
import com.azure.cosmos.models.CosmosItemRequestOptions;
import com.azure.cosmos.models.PriorityLevel;

class Family{
   String id;
   String lastName;
}

//define throughput control group with low priority
ThroughputControlGroupConfig groupConfig = new ThroughputControlGroupConfigBuilder()
                .groupName("low-priority-group")
                .priorityLevel(PriorityLevel.LOW)
                .build();
container.enableLocalThroughputControlGroup(groupConfig);

CosmosItemRequestOptions requestOptions = new CosmosItemRequestOptions();
        requestOptions.setThroughputControlGroupName(groupConfig.getGroupName());

Family family = new Family();
family.setLastName("Anderson");


// Insert this item with low priority in the container using request options.
container.createItem(family, new PartitionKey(family.getLastName()), requestOptions)
    .doOnSuccess((response) -> {
        logger.info("inserted doc with id: {}", response.getItem().getId());
    }).doOnError((exception) -> {
        logger.error("Exception. e: {}", exception.getLocalizedMessage(), exception);
    }).subscribe();
    
```
#### [Python SDK](#tab/python) 

Priority-based execution feature is a preview feature available in Python SDK v4.6.0 or later. It should be enabled at the account level before using it in the Python SDK.
The request priority can be specified as "Low" or "High" as below:

```python
item1_read = container.read_item("item1", "pk1", priority="High")
item2_read = container.read_item("item2", "pk2", priority="Low")
query = list(container.query_items("Select * from c", partition_key="pk1", priority="High"))
```

## Monitor priority-based execution

You can monitor the behavior of requests with low and high priority using Azure Monitor metrics in the Azure portal.
To learn more about metrics, see [Azure Monitor metrics](monitor-reference.md#metrics).

## Change default priority level of a Cosmos DB account

If Priority-based execution is enabled and priority level isn't specified for a request by the user, then all such requests are executed with **high** priority. You can change the default priority level of requests in a Cosmos DB account using Azure CLI. 

#### Azure CLI
```azurecli-interactive
# install preview Azure CLI version 0.26.0 or later
az extension add --name cosmosdb-preview --version 0.26.0

# set subscription context
az account set -s $SubscriptionId

# Enable priority-based execution
az cosmosdb update  --resource-group $ResourceGroup --name $AccountName --enable-priority-based-execution true

# change default priority level
az cosmosdb update  --resource-group $ResourceGroup --name $AccountName --default-priority-level low
```

## Data explorer priority

When Priority-based execution is enabled for a Cosmos DB account, all requests in the Azure portal's Data Explorer are executed with **low** priority. You can adjust this by changing the priority setting in the Data Explorer's **Settings** menu.

> [!NOTE]
>This client-side configuration is specific to the concerned user's Data explorer view only and won't affect other users' Data explorer priority level or the default priority level of the Cosmos DB account.

## Limitations

- Priority-based execution is currently not supported for 
**serverless** database accounts.
- The behavior of priority-based execution feature is non-deterministic for shared throughput database containers.

## Known issues

- For strong and bounded staleness consistency levels, read request prioritization may not work effectively allowing low priority write requests to execute irrespective of high priority read traffic.
