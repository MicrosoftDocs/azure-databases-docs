# View and delete multiple items in Azure Cosmos DB Data Explorer

[!INCLUDE[NoSQL, MongoDB](includes/appliesto-nosql-mongodb.md)]

Use the Data Explorer for Azure Cosmos DB to select and delete multiple items directly in the Azure portal. This feature makes it easier to batch manage multiple items without executing a query.

## Prerequisites

- An existing Azure Cosmos DB account.
  - If you have an Azure subscription, [create a new API for NoSQL account](nosql/how-to-create-account.md?tabs=azure-portal).
  - If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn) before you begin.

## Delete multiple items

First, use the multiple selection feature to perform a delete operation over multiple items.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal (<https://portal.azure.com>).

1. Navigate to your existing Azure Cosmos DB account.

1. In the resource menu, select **Data Explorer**.

1. Navigate to the **Items** page corresponding to any existing database and container.

1. On the **Items** page, select the checkbox corresponding with all items you wish to manage in a single operation.

    > [!TIP]
    > Alternatively, you can either select multiple items using the <kbd>Shift</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> keys. You can also use the checkbox in the table header to automatically select all items in the current view.

    > [!NOTE]
    > By default, the items view only includes 100 matching items. Select **Load more** to include more items within the current view. Please be aware if you are using a legacy Azure Cosmos DB collection without a partition key the bulk delete feature is currently temporarily unavailable.  You many still delete items individually as needed.

1. In the command bar, select **Delete**.

    > [!TIP]
    > Alternatively, you can use the <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> or <kbd>Opt</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> keyboard shortcut.

1. In the confirmation dialog, select **Yes** to confirm that the multiple delete operation was intentional.

1. Wait for the operation to complete in the container. The results of the operation are available in the status bar.

## Adjust viewport

Now, use the adjustment features in the Data Explorer to adjust the viewport of items.

1. Navigate to the Data Explorer interface for your existing Azure Cosmos DB account again.

1. On the **Items** page, drag and move the separator between columns to adjust how much content is viewable for each column.

1. Observe that the content rendered for each item updates automatically as the column sizes are adjusted.

## Comments

Use the **Feedback** icon in the command bar of the Data Explorer to give the product team any comments you have about the bulk delete experience.
