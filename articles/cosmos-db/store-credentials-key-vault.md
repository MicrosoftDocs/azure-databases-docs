# Tutorial: Store and use Azure Cosmos DB credentials with Azure Key Vault

[!INCLUDE[NoSQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin, Table](includes/appliesto-nosql-mongodb-cassandra-gremlin-table.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's recommended to access Azure Cosmos DB is to use a system-assigned managed identity. If both the managed identity solution and cert based solution do not meet your needs, please use the Azure Key vault solution in this article.

If you're using Azure Cosmos DB as your database, you connect to databases, container, and items by using an SDK, the API endpoint, and either the primary or secondary key.

It's not a good practice to store the endpoint URI and sensitive read-write keys directly within application code or configuration file. Ideally, this data is read from environment variables within the host. In Azure App Service, [app settings](/azure/app-service/configure-common#configure-app-settings) allow you to inject runtime credentials for your Azure Cosmos DB account without the need for developers to store these credentials in an insecure clear text manner.

Azure Key Vault iterates on this best practice further by allowing you to store these credentials securely while giving services like Azure App Service managed access to the credentials. Azure App Service will securely read your credentials from Azure Key Vault and inject those credentials into your running application.

With this best practice, developers can store the credentials for tools like the [Azure Cosmos DB emulator](emulator.md) or [Try Azure Cosmos DB free](try-free.md) during development. Then, the operations team can ensure that the correct production settings are injected at runtime.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Create an Azure Key Vault instance
> - Add Azure Cosmos DB credentials as secrets to the key vault
> - Create and register an Azure App Service resource and grant "read key" permissions
> - Inject key vault secrets into the App Service resource
>

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial and the sample application uses an Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account. You can perform many of the same steps using other APIs.

## Prerequisites

- An existing Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account.
  - If you have an Azure subscription, [create a new account](nosql/how-to-create-account.md?tabs=azure-portal).
  - If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
  - Alternatively, you can [try Azure Cosmos DB free](try-free.md) before you commit.
- GitHub account.

## Before you begin: Get Azure Cosmos DB credentials

Before you start, you'll get the credentials for your existing account.

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) page for the existing Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account.

1. From the Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account page, select the **Keys** navigation menu option.

## Create an Azure Key Vault resource

First, create a new key vault to store your API for NoSQL credentials.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Select **Create a resource > Security > Key Vault**.

1. On the **Create key vault** page, enter the following information:

    | Setting | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Subscription** | Select the Azure subscription that you wish to use for this Azure Cosmos account. |
    | **Resource group** | Select a resource group, or select **Create new**, then enter a unique name for the new resource group. |
    | **Key vault name** | Enter a globally unique name for your key vault. |
    | **Region** | Select a geographic location to host your Azure Cosmos DB account. Use the location that is closest to your users to give them the fastest access to the data. |
    | **Pricing tier** | Select *Standard*. |

1. Leave the remaining settings to their default values.
  
1. Select **Review + create**.

1. Review the settings you provide, and then select **Create**. It takes a few minutes to create the account. Wait for the portal page to display **Your deployment is complete** before moving on.

## Add Azure Cosmos DB access keys to the Key Vault

Now, store your Azure Cosmos DB credentials as secrets in the key vault.

1. Select **Go to resource** to go to the Azure Key Vault resource page.

1. From the Azure Key Vault resource page, select the **Secrets** navigation menu option.

1. Select **Generate/Import** from the menu.

   :::image type="content" source="media/access-secrets-from-keyvault/create-new-secret.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Generate/Import option in a key vault menu.":::

1. On the **Create a secret** page, enter the following information:

    | Setting | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Upload options** | *Manual* |
    | **Name** | *cosmos-endpoint* |
    | **Secret value** | Enter the **URI** you copied earlier in this tutorial. |

   :::image type="content" source="media/access-secrets-from-keyvault/create-endpoint-secret.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Create a secret dialog in the Azure portal with details for an URI secret.":::

1. Select **Create** to create the new **cosmos-endpoint** secret.

1. Select **Generate/Import** from the menu again. On the **Create a secret** page, enter the following information:

    | Setting | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Upload options** | *Manual* |
    | **Name** | *cosmos-readwrite-key* |
    | **Secret value** | Enter the **PRIMARY KEY** you copied earlier in this tutorial. |

   :::image type="content" source="media/access-secrets-from-keyvault/create-key-secret.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Create a secret dialog in the Azure portal with details for a PRIMARY KEY secret.":::

1. Select **Create** to create the new **cosmos-readwrite-key** secret.

1. After the secrets are created, view them in the list of secrets within the **Secrets** page.

    :::image type="content" source="media/access-secrets-from-keyvault/view-secrets-list.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the list of secrets for a key vault.":::

1. Select each key, select the latest version, and then copy the **Secret Identifier**. You'll use the identifier for the **cosmos-endpoint** and **cosmos-readwrite-key** secrets later in this tutorial.

    > [!TIP]
    > The secret identifier will be in this format `https://<key-vault-name>.vault.azure.net/secrets/<secret-name>/<version-id>`. For example, if the name of the key vault is **msdocs-key-vault**, the name of the key is **cosmos-readwrite-key**, and the version if **83b995e363d947999ac6cf487ae0e12e**; then the secret identifier would be `https://msdocs-key-vault.vault.azure.net/secrets/cosmos-readwrite-key/83b995e363d947999ac6cf487ae0e12e`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In this example screenshot, the web app is named **msdocs-dotnet-web**.

1. Select **Next** again to skip the **Application** tab. On the **Review + create** tab, review the settings you provide, and then select **Create**.

1. Return to the web app page in the Azure portal. Select **Configuration** from the navigation menu.

1. On the **Configuration** page, select **New application setting**. In the **Add/Edit application setting** dialog, enter the following information:

    | Setting | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Name** | `CREDENTIALS__ENDPOINT` |
    | **Key** | Get the **secret identifier** for the **cosmos-endpoint** secret in your key vault that you created earlier in this tutorial. Enter the identifier in the following format: `@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=<secret-identifier>)`. |

    > [!TIP]
    > Ensure that the environment variable has a double underscore (`__`) value instead of a single underscore. The double-underscore is a key delimeter supported by .NET on all platforms. For more information, see [environment variables configuration](/dotnet/core/extensions/configuration-providers#environment-variable-configuration-provider).

    > [!NOTE]
    > For example, if the secret identifier is `https://msdocs-key-vault.vault.azure.net/secrets/cosmos-endpoint/69621c59ef5b4b7294b5def118921b07`, then the reference would be `@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=https://msdocs-key-vault.vault.azure.net/secrets/cosmos-endpoint/69621c59ef5b4b7294b5def118921b07)`.
