# Sample supply chain traceability solution using Azure Cosmos DB for Gremlin

[!INCLUDE[Note - Recommended services](includes/note-recommended-services.md)]

This article provides an overview of the [traceability graph solution implemented by Infosys](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/infosysltd.infosys-traceability-knowledge-graph?tab=Overview) in Azure Marketplace.

This solution implements end-to-end supply chain traceability using Azure Cosmos DB for Gremlin and other Azure services. The solution enables organizations to track and trace finished goods, raw materials, and their relationships throughout the supply chain. This solution supports food safety, regulatory compliance, and rapid incident response.

The solution uses a graph database model to represent complex relationships and movements of goods, and integrates with Azure services for data ingestion, processing, analytics, and user access. This article is relevant for supply chain managers, architects, and IT professionals seeking to modernize traceability processes.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE[Prerequisites - Account with sample data](includes/prerequisites-account-sample-data.md)]

- Familiarity with supply chain processes and data

## Process overview

To get started with the supply chain traceability solution, follow these steps:

### Data storage

- Create a Cosmos DB account with the Gremlin (graph) API.
- Define the data model for raw materials, finished goods, pallets, and warehouses as graph vertices and edges.

### Data ingestion and integration

- Set up Azure Event Hubs to receive streaming data from factories, warehouses, and logistics providers.
- Use Azure API Management to expose APIs for stock movement and quality events.
- Implement Azure Functions to process incoming events and write to Cosmos DB.

### Analytics and user access

- Use Azure Cognitive Search to enable advanced search and filtering of supply chain data.
- Integrate Azure Databricks and Synapse Analytics for reporting and analytics.
- Deploy a user portal using Azure App Service for search and visualization.

### Archive and manage data

- Use Azure Storage to archive historical and regulatory data as needed.

## End user guidance and support

To help your organization adopt the solution:

- Provide training on using the user portal for search and reporting.
- Share documentation on how to interpret graph-based traceability data.
- Offer support channels for troubleshooting and feedback.
